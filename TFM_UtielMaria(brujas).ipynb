The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\\r\\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\\r\\nclassed as \\u201chistorical\\u201d in the children\\u2019s library; for the time has\\r\\ncome for a series of newer \\u201cwonder tales\\u201d in which the stereotyped\\r\\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\\r\\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\\r\\nfearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality;\\r\\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\\r\\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \\u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\u201d\\r\\nwas written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a\\r\\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\\r\\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\r\\n\\r\\nL. Frank Baum\\r\\nChicago, April, 1900.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter I\\r\\nThe Cyclone\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\\r\\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer\\u2019s wife. Their\\r\\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\\r\\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\\r\\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\\r\\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\\r\\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\\r\\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\\u2014except a\\r\\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\\r\\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\\r\\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\\r\\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\r\\nhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\r\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\\r\\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\\r\\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\\r\\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\\r\\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\\r\\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\\r\\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\\r\\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\\r\\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\\r\\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\\r\\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\\r\\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\\r\\nbeen so startled by the child\\u2019s laughter that she would scream and\\r\\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy\\u2019s merry voice reached\\r\\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\\r\\ncould find anything to laugh at.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\\r\\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\\r\\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\\r\\nas her other surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black\\r\\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\\r\\neither side of his funny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and\\r\\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the\\r\\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\\r\\nusual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\\r\\nthe sky too. Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\\r\\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\\r\\ncoming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\\r\\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\\r\\ngrass coming from that direction also.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a cyclone coming, Em,\\u201d he called to his wife. \\u201cI\\u2019ll go look\\r\\nafter the stock.\\u201d Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\\r\\nhorses were kept.\\r\\n\\r\\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of\\r\\nthe danger close at hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuick, Dorothy!\\u201d she screamed. \\u201cRun for the cellar!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nToto jumped out of Dorothy\\u2019s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\\r\\nstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door\\r\\nin the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole.\\r\\nDorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she\\r\\nwas halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind,\\r\\nand the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down\\r\\nsuddenly upon the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a strange thing happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\\r\\nair. Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the\\r\\nexact center of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is\\r\\ngenerally still, but the great pressure of the wind on every side of\\r\\nthe house raised it up higher and higher, until it was at the very top\\r\\nof the cyclone; and there it remained and was carried miles and miles\\r\\naway as easily as you could carry a feather.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy\\r\\nfound she was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around,\\r\\nand one other time when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were\\r\\nbeing rocked gently, like a baby in a cradle.\\r\\n\\r\\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there,\\r\\nbarking loudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to\\r\\nsee what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first\\r\\nthe little girl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his\\r\\nears sticking up through the hole, for the strong pressure of the air\\r\\nwas keeping him up so that he could not fall. She crept to the hole,\\r\\ncaught Toto by the ear, and dragged him into the room again, afterward\\r\\nclosing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright;\\r\\nbut she felt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about\\r\\nher that she nearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would\\r\\nbe dashed to pieces when the house fell again; but as the hours passed\\r\\nand nothing terrible happened, she stopped worrying and resolved to\\r\\nwait calmly and see what the future would bring. At last she crawled\\r\\nover the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and Toto\\r\\nfollowed and lay down beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind,\\r\\nDorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter II\\r\\nThe Council with the Munchkins\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had\\r\\nnot been lying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the\\r\\njar made her catch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto\\r\\nput his cold little nose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat\\r\\nup and noticed that the house was not moving; nor was it dark, for the\\r\\nbright sunshine came in at the window, flooding the little room. She\\r\\nsprang from her bed and with Toto at her heels ran and opened the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes\\r\\ngrowing bigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently\\u2014for a cyclone\\u2014in the\\r\\nmidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of\\r\\ngreensward all about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious\\r\\nfruits. Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with\\r\\nrare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.\\r\\nA little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between\\r\\ngreen banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl\\r\\nwho had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\\r\\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\\r\\never seen. They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\\r\\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\\r\\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\\r\\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\\r\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\r\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\\r\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman\\u2019s hat was white, and she\\r\\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\\r\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\\r\\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\\r\\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\\r\\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\\r\\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\\r\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\r\\nstiffly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\r\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\\r\\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\\r\\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\\r\\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\\r\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\\r\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\\r\\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\\r\\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\\r\\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\\r\\nwith hesitation, \\u201cYou are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\\r\\nhave not killed anything.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYour house did, anyway,\\u201d replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\\r\\n\\u201cand that is the same thing. See!\\u201d she continued, pointing to the\\r\\ncorner of the house. \\u201cThere are her two feet, still sticking out from\\r\\nunder a block of wood.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\\r\\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\\r\\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear!\\u201d cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\r\\ndismay. \\u201cThe house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere is nothing to be done,\\u201d said the little woman calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut who was she?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShe was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\\u201d answered the little\\r\\nwoman. \\u201cShe has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\\r\\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\\r\\nare grateful to you for the favor.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho are the Munchkins?\\u201d inquired Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\\r\\nWitch ruled.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre you a Munchkin?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\\r\\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\r\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, gracious!\\u201d cried Dorothy. \\u201cAre you a real witch?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, indeed,\\u201d answered the little woman. \\u201cBut I am a good witch, and\\r\\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\\r\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I thought all witches were wicked,\\u201d said the girl, who was half\\r\\nfrightened at facing a real witch. \\u201cOh, no, that is a great mistake.\\r\\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\\r\\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know\\r\\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.\\r\\nThose who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\\r\\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\\r\\nin all the Land of Oz\\u2014the one who lives in the West.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut,\\u201d said Dorothy, after a moment\\u2019s thought, \\u201cAunt Em has told me\\r\\nthat the witches were all dead\\u2014years and years ago.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho is Aunt Em?\\u201d inquired the little old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShe is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed\\r\\nand her eyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, \\u201cI do not\\r\\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\\r\\nbefore. But tell me, is it a civilized country?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes,\\u201d replied Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\\r\\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But,\\r\\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\\r\\nfrom all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and\\r\\nwizards amongst us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho are the wizards?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOz himself is the Great Wizard,\\u201d answered the Witch, sinking her voice\\r\\nto a whisper. \\u201cHe is more powerful than all the rest of us together. He\\r\\nlives in the City of Emeralds.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\\r\\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\\r\\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\\r\\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing\\r\\nwas left but the silver shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShe was so old,\\u201d explained the Witch of the North, \\u201cthat she dried up\\r\\nquickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\\r\\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.\\u201d She reached down and picked up\\r\\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to\\r\\nDorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\\u201d said one of\\r\\nthe Munchkins, \\u201cand there is some charm connected with them; but what\\r\\nit is we never knew.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.\\r\\nThen she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\\r\\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\\r\\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAt the East, not far from here,\\u201d said one, \\u201cthere is a great desert,\\r\\nand none could live to cross it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is the same at the South,\\u201d said another, \\u201cfor I have been there and\\r\\nseen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am told,\\u201d said the third man, \\u201cthat it is the same at the West. And\\r\\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\\r\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe North is my home,\\u201d said the old lady, \\u201cand at its edge is the same\\r\\ngreat desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I\\u2019m afraid, my dear, you\\r\\nwill have to live with us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these\\r\\nstrange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,\\r\\nfor they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep\\r\\nalso. As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\\r\\nthe point on the end of her nose, while she counted \\u201cOne, two, three\\u201d\\r\\nin a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\\r\\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\\r\\nwords on it, asked, \\u201cIs your name Dorothy, my dear?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere is this city?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\r\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs he a good man?\\u201d inquired the girl anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\r\\nhave never seen him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow can I get there?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\\r\\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\\r\\nall the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWon\\u2019t you go with me?\\u201d pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\\r\\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, I cannot do that,\\u201d she replied, \\u201cbut I will give you my kiss, and\\r\\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\\r\\nthe North.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\\r\\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\\r\\nfound out soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\\u201d said the\\r\\nWitch, \\u201cso you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\r\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\\r\\nafter which they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy\\r\\na friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and\\r\\nstraightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who\\r\\nbarked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been\\r\\nafraid even to growl while she stood by.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\\r\\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter III\\r\\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to\\r\\nthe cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.\\r\\nShe gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it\\r\\ndown to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.\\r\\nToto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting\\r\\nthere. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\\r\\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\\r\\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\\r\\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\\r\\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\\r\\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\\r\\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\\r\\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\\r\\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\\r\\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\\r\\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\\r\\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\\u201d she said. And\\r\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\\r\\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\\r\\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI wonder if they will fit me,\\u201d she said to Toto. \\u201cThey would be just\\r\\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\\r\\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally she picked up her basket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome along, Toto,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe will go to the Emerald City and ask\\r\\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\\r\\nof her dress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\\r\\nstarted on her journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\\r\\nthe one paved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking\\r\\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\\r\\nthe hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang\\r\\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\\r\\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\\r\\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\\r\\nwas about her. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted\\r\\na dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\\r\\nvegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\\r\\nable to raise large crops. Once in a while she would pass a house, and\\r\\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\\r\\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\\r\\nsetting them free from bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were\\r\\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.\\r\\nAll were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\\r\\nfavorite color.\\r\\n\\r\\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\\r\\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\\r\\nlarger than the rest. On the green lawn before it many men and women\\r\\nwere dancing. Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\\r\\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\\r\\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\\r\\ngood things to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\\r\\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\\r\\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\\r\\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\\r\\nhimself, whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\\r\\npeople dance.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \\u201cYou must be a great sorceress.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy?\\u201d asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\\r\\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\\r\\nwear white.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy dress is blue and white checked,\\u201d said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\r\\nwrinkles in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is kind of you to wear that,\\u201d said Boq. \\u201cBlue is the color of the\\r\\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\\r\\nwitch.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\\r\\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\r\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\\r\\nland.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\r\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made\\r\\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\\r\\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played\\r\\nwith Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that\\r\\ngreatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,\\r\\nfor they had never seen a dog before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow far is it to the Emerald City?\\u201d the girl asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI do not know,\\u201d answered Boq gravely, \\u201cfor I have never been there. It\\r\\nis better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\\r\\nwith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take\\r\\nyou many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass\\r\\nthrough rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your\\r\\njourney.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz\\r\\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\\r\\nyellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would\\r\\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\\r\\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\\r\\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\\r\\nthe ripe corn.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\\r\\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\\r\\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\\r\\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\\r\\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\\r\\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\\r\\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\\r\\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\\r\\nback.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\\r\\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\\r\\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\\r\\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\\r\\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\\r\\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood day,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDid you speak?\\u201d asked the girl, in wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCertainly,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \\u201cHow do you do?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m pretty well, thank you,\\u201d replied Dorothy politely. \\u201cHow do you\\r\\ndo?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not feeling well,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \\u201cfor it is\\r\\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019t you get down?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\\r\\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\\r\\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you very much,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\\r\\nthe ground. \\u201cI feel like a new man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\\r\\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho are you?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\\r\\nyawned. \\u201cAnd where are you going?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy name is Dorothy,\\u201d said the girl, \\u201cand I am going to the Emerald\\r\\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere is the Emerald City?\\u201d he inquired. \\u201cAnd who is Oz?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, don\\u2019t you know?\\u201d she returned, in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, indeed. I don\\u2019t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\\r\\nbrains at all,\\u201d he answered sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cI\\u2019m awfully sorry for you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you think,\\u201d he asked, \\u201cif I go to the Emerald City with you, that\\r\\nOz would give me some brains?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI cannot tell,\\u201d she returned, \\u201cbut you may come with me, if you like.\\r\\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\\r\\nare now.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is true,\\u201d said the Scarecrow. \\u201cYou see,\\u201d he continued\\r\\nconfidentially, \\u201cI don\\u2019t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\\r\\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\\r\\ninto me, it doesn\\u2019t matter, for I can\\u2019t feel it. But I do not want\\r\\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\\r\\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI understand how you feel,\\u201d said the little girl, who was truly sorry\\r\\nfor him. \\u201cIf you will come with me I\\u2019ll ask Oz to do all he can for\\r\\nyou.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he answered gratefully.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\\r\\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\r\\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\\r\\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\\r\\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t mind Toto,\\u201d said Dorothy to her new friend. \\u201cHe never bites.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I\\u2019m not afraid,\\u201d replied the Scarecrow. \\u201cHe can\\u2019t hurt the straw.\\r\\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can\\u2019t\\r\\nget tired. I\\u2019ll tell you a secret,\\u201d he continued, as he walked along.\\r\\n\\u201cThere is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d asked Dorothy; \\u201cthe Munchkin farmer who made you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow; \\u201cit\\u2019s a lighted match.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IV\\r\\nThe Road Through the Forest\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\\r\\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,\\r\\nwhich were here very uneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\\r\\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\\r\\nwalked around. As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked\\r\\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\\r\\non the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick\\r\\nhim up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing\\r\\nmerrily at his own mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\\r\\nback. There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\\r\\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy\\r\\nopened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the\\r\\nScarecrow, but he refused.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am never hungry,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand it is a lucky thing I am not, for my\\r\\nmouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,\\r\\nthe straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the\\r\\nshape of my head.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on\\r\\neating her bread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTell me something about yourself and the country you came from,\\u201d said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all\\r\\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\\r\\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, \\u201cI cannot understand why\\r\\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\\r\\ngray place you call Kansas.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is because you have no brains\\u201d answered the girl. \\u201cNo matter how\\r\\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\\r\\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.\\r\\nThere is no place like home.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOf course I cannot understand it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf your heads were\\r\\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\r\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is\\r\\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWon\\u2019t you tell me a story, while we are resting?\\u201d asked the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\r\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\\r\\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\\r\\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\\r\\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\\r\\nI heard was the farmer saying, \\u2018How do you like those ears?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018They aren\\u2019t straight,\\u2019\\u201d answered the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Never mind,\\u2019\\u201d said the farmer. \\u201c\\u2018They are ears just the same,\\u2019\\u201d which\\r\\nwas true enough.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Now I\\u2019ll make the eyes,\\u2019\\u201d said the farmer. So he painted my right\\r\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\r\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\\r\\nfirst glimpse of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018That\\u2019s a rather pretty eye,\\u2019\\u201d remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\r\\nthe farmer. \\u201c\\u2018Blue paint is just the color for eyes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I think I\\u2019ll make the other a little bigger,\\u2019\\u201d said the farmer. And\\r\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\\r\\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\\r\\nI didn\\u2019t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\\r\\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\\r\\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\\r\\nanyone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,\\u2019 said the farmer. \\u2018He\\r\\nlooks just like a man.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Why, he is a man,\\u2019 said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\\r\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\r\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\\r\\naway and left me alone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\\r\\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\\r\\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\\r\\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\\r\\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\\r\\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\\r\\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\\r\\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\\r\\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.\\u2019 Then he\\r\\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\\r\\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\\r\\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\r\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, \\u2018If you only had\\r\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\r\\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\\r\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAfter the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\r\\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\\r\\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\\r\\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI hope so,\\u201d said Dorothy earnestly, \\u201csince you seem anxious to have\\r\\nthem.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes; I am anxious,\\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \\u201cIt is such an\\r\\nuncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said the girl, \\u201clet us go.\\u201d And she handed the basket to the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough\\r\\nand untilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the\\r\\ntrees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the\\r\\nroad of yellow brick. It was almost dark under the trees, for the\\r\\nbranches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and\\r\\nwent on into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf this road goes in, it must come out,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cand as\\r\\nthe Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever\\r\\nit leads us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnyone would know that,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCertainly; that is why I know it,\\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \\u201cIf it\\r\\nrequired brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves\\r\\nstumbling along in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto\\r\\ncould, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow\\r\\ndeclared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm\\r\\nand managed to get along fairly well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,\\u201d she\\r\\nsaid, \\u201cyou must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the\\r\\ndark.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the Scarecrow stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI see a little cottage at the right of us,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbuilt of logs\\r\\nand branches. Shall we go there?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, indeed,\\u201d answered the child. \\u201cI am all tired out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the\\r\\ncottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one\\r\\ncorner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a\\r\\nsound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another\\r\\ncorner and waited patiently until morning came.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter V\\r\\nThe Rescue of the Tin Woodman\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had\\r\\nlong been out chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and\\r\\nlooked around her. There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in\\r\\nhis corner, waiting for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must go and search for water,\\u201d she said to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy do you want water?\\u201d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTo wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the\\r\\ndry bread will not stick in my throat.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,\\u201d said the Scarecrow\\r\\nthoughtfully, \\u201cfor you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have\\r\\nbrains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\\r\\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\\r\\nher breakfast. She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and\\r\\nthe girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for\\r\\nthere was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of\\r\\nyellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat was that?\\u201d she asked timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI cannot imagine,\\u201d replied the Scarecrow; \\u201cbut we can go and see.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\\r\\ncome from behind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few\\r\\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\\r\\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\\r\\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\\r\\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\\r\\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\\r\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\\r\\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\\r\\nteeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDid you groan?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d answered the tin man, \\u201cI did. I\\u2019ve been groaning for more than a\\r\\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat can I do for you?\\u201d she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\\r\\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGet an oil-can and oil my joints,\\u201d he answered. \\u201cThey are rusted so\\r\\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\r\\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\\r\\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \\u201cWhere are your joints?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOil my neck, first,\\u201d replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\\r\\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\\r\\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\\r\\nman could turn it himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow oil the joints in my arms,\\u201d he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\\r\\nand as good as new.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\\r\\nhe leaned against the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is a great comfort,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have been holding that axe in\\r\\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I\\u2019m glad to be able to put it down at\\r\\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\\r\\nonce more.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\\r\\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\\r\\ncreature, and very grateful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI might have stood there always if you had not come along,\\u201d he said;\\r\\n\\u201cso you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\\u201d she\\r\\nanswered, \\u201cand we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy do you wish to see Oz?\\u201d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\\r\\nput a few brains into his head,\\u201d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, I guess so,\\u201d Dorothy answered. \\u201cIt would be as easy as to give\\r\\nthe Scarecrow brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTrue,\\u201d the Tin Woodman returned. \\u201cSo, if you will allow me to join\\r\\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome along,\\u201d said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\\r\\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\\r\\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\\r\\nthat was paved with yellow brick.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\\r\\n\\u201cFor,\\u201d he said, \\u201cif I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I\\r\\nwould need the oil-can badly.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for\\r\\nsoon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\\r\\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\\r\\ntravelers could not pass. But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\\r\\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\\r\\nparty.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\\r\\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\\r\\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t you walk around the hole?\\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know enough,\\u201d replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \\u201cMy head is\\r\\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\\r\\nhim for some brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I see,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \\u201cBut, after all, brains are not the\\r\\nbest things in the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHave you any?\\u201d inquired the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, my head is quite empty,\\u201d answered the Woodman. \\u201cBut once I had\\r\\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\r\\nrather have a heart.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd why is that?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will tell you my story, and then you will know.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\r\\nthe following story:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\\r\\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\\r\\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\\r\\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\\r\\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\r\\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\\r\\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\\r\\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\\r\\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\\r\\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\\r\\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\\r\\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\\r\\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\r\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\\r\\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\\r\\nleft leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\r\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\\r\\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\\r\\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\\r\\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\\r\\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\\r\\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\\r\\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\\r\\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\\r\\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\\r\\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\\r\\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\r\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\\r\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\r\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\\r\\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\\r\\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\r\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\\r\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\r\\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\\r\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\\r\\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\\r\\nwas only one danger\\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\\r\\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\\r\\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\\r\\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\\r\\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\\r\\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\\r\\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\\r\\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\\r\\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\\r\\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\\r\\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\\r\\nnew heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll the same,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cI shall ask for brains instead of\\r\\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\\r\\none.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI shall take the heart,\\u201d returned the Tin Woodman; \\u201cfor brains do not\\r\\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\\r\\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\\r\\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\\r\\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\\r\\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither\\r\\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\\r\\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VI\\r\\nThe Cowardly Lion\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\\r\\nthick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were\\r\\nmuch covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the\\r\\nwalking was not at all good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\\r\\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there\\r\\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These\\r\\nsounds made the little girl\\u2019s heart beat fast, for she did not know\\r\\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy\\u2019s side,\\r\\nand did not even bark in return.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow long will it be,\\u201d the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \\u201cbefore we\\r\\nare out of the forest?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI cannot tell,\\u201d was the answer, \\u201cfor I have never been to the Emerald\\r\\nCity. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\\r\\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\\r\\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so\\r\\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\\r\\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch\\u2019s kiss, and that\\r\\nwill protect you from harm.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut Toto!\\u201d said the girl anxiously. \\u201cWhat will protect him?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,\\u201d replied the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\\r\\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\\r\\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\\r\\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,\\r\\nto the Lion\\u2019s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\\r\\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\\r\\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\\r\\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\\r\\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while\\r\\nshe cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\\r\\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t bite him,\\u201d said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw\\r\\nwhere Dorothy had hit it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, but you tried to,\\u201d she retorted. \\u201cYou are nothing but a big\\r\\ncoward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know it,\\u201d said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always\\r\\nknown it. But how can I help it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\\r\\nthe poor Scarecrow!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs he stuffed?\\u201d asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\\r\\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\\r\\nshape again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOf course he\\u2019s stuffed,\\u201d replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s why he went over so easily,\\u201d remarked the Lion. \\u201cIt astonished\\r\\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201che\\u2019s made of tin.\\u201d And she helped the Woodman up\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s why he nearly blunted my claws,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cWhen they\\r\\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What\\r\\nis that little animal you are so tender of?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe is my dog, Toto,\\u201d answered Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs he made of tin, or stuffed?\\u201d asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNeither. He\\u2019s a\\u2014a\\u2014a meat dog,\\u201d said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! He\\u2019s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\\r\\nat him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\\r\\ncoward like me,\\u201d continued the Lion sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat makes you a coward?\\u201d asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\\r\\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a mystery,\\u201d replied the Lion. \\u201cI suppose I was born that way. All\\r\\nthe other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for\\r\\nthe Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that\\r\\nif I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out\\r\\nof my way. Whenever I\\u2019ve met a man I\\u2019ve been awfully scared; but I just\\r\\nroared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If\\r\\nthe elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,\\r\\nI should have run myself\\u2014I\\u2019m such a coward; but just as soon as they\\r\\nhear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them\\r\\ngo.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut that isn\\u2019t right. The King of Beasts shouldn\\u2019t be a coward,\\u201d said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know it,\\u201d returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\\r\\nof his tail. \\u201cIt is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\\r\\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerhaps you have heart disease,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt may be,\\u201d said the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf you have,\\u201d continued the Tin Woodman, \\u201cyou ought to be glad, for it\\r\\nproves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have\\r\\nheart disease.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerhaps,\\u201d said the Lion thoughtfully, \\u201cif I had no heart I should not\\r\\nbe a coward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHave you brains?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI suppose so. I\\u2019ve never looked to see,\\u201d replied the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,\\u201d remarked the\\r\\nScarecrow, \\u201cfor my head is stuffed with straw.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\\u201d said the Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\\u201d added\\r\\nDorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you think Oz could give me courage?\\u201d asked the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cJust as easily as he could give me brains,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOr give me a heart,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOr send me back to Kansas,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen, if you don\\u2019t mind, I\\u2019ll go with you,\\u201d said the Lion, \\u201cfor my\\r\\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou will be very welcome,\\u201d answered Dorothy, \\u201cfor you will help to\\r\\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\\r\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey really are,\\u201d said the Lion, \\u201cbut that doesn\\u2019t make me any braver,\\r\\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\\r\\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy\\u2019s side. Toto did not approve of\\r\\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had\\r\\nbeen crushed between the Lion\\u2019s great jaws. But after a time he became\\r\\nmore at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be\\r\\ngood friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\\r\\npeace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\\r\\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\\r\\nthing. This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\r\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\\r\\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his\\r\\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When\\r\\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\\r\\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly\\r\\nfrightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but\\r\\nshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was\\r\\nwrong. But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy\\u2019s basket and\\r\\noiled the Woodman\\u2019s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as\\r\\nwell as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis will serve me a lesson,\\u201d said he, \\u201cto look where I step. For if I\\r\\nshould kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying\\r\\nrusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and\\r\\nwhen he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to\\r\\nharm it. The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore\\r\\nhe took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou people with hearts,\\u201d he said, \\u201chave something to guide you, and\\r\\nneed never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\r\\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn\\u2019t mind so much.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VII\\r\\nThe Journey to the Great Oz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\\r\\nforest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick\\r\\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\\r\\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\\r\\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\\r\\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf you wish,\\u201d said the Lion, \\u201cI will go into the forest and kill a\\r\\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\r\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\\r\\ngood breakfast.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t! Please don\\u2019t,\\u201d begged the Tin Woodman. \\u201cI should certainly weep\\r\\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\\r\\none ever knew what it was, for he didn\\u2019t mention it. And the Scarecrow\\r\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy\\u2019s basket with them, so\\r\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\\r\\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\\r\\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\\r\\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\\r\\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\\r\\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\\r\\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\\r\\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\\r\\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\\r\\nkept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\r\\nbrook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been\\r\\nwalking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed\\r\\nthe road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either\\r\\nside. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\r\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\r\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none\\r\\nof them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey\\r\\nmust end.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall we do?\\u201d asked Dorothy despairingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI haven\\u2019t the faintest idea,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\r\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow said, \\u201cWe cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\r\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it,\\r\\nwe must stop where we are.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI think I could jump over it,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\r\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen we are all right,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow, \\u201cfor you can carry us\\r\\nall over on your back, one at a time.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll try it,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cWho will go first?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will,\\u201d declared the Scarecrow, \\u201cfor, if you found that you could not\\r\\njump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\r\\ndented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter\\r\\nso much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, \\u201cbut\\r\\nI suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we\\r\\nwill make the attempt.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion\\u2019s back, and the big beast walked to the\\r\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you run and jump?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause that isn\\u2019t the way we Lions do these things,\\u201d he replied. Then\\r\\ngiving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the\\r\\nother side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,\\r\\nand after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang\\r\\nacross the ditch again.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\r\\nclimbed on the Lion\\u2019s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.\\r\\nThe next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and\\r\\nthen, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other\\r\\nside. The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then\\r\\nthey all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest,\\r\\nfor his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big\\r\\ndog that has been running too long.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and\\r\\ngloomy. After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow\\r\\nbrick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would\\r\\ncome to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To\\r\\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\\r\\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\\r\\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat are the Kalidahs?\\u201d asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\r\\ntigers,\\u201d replied the Lion, \\u201cand with claws so long and sharp that they\\r\\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I\\u2019m terribly\\r\\nafraid of the Kalidahs.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m not surprised that you are,\\u201d returned Dorothy. \\u201cThey must be\\r\\ndreadful beasts.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\\r\\nacross the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\\r\\nat once he could not leap across it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\\r\\nthought the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\\r\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\\r\\nacross it easily.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is a first-rate idea,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cOne would almost suspect\\r\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\\r\\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\\r\\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\\r\\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\\r\\nbranches on the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\r\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\\r\\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey are the Kalidahs!\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuick!\\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \\u201cLet us cross over.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\\r\\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\\r\\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\\r\\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\\r\\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\\r\\nin surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\\r\\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\r\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\\r\\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\\r\\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\r\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\\r\\nalive.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWait a minute!\\u201d called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\\r\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\\r\\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\\r\\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\\r\\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\\r\\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\\r\\nrocks at the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \\u201cI see\\r\\nwe are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it\\r\\nmust be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures\\r\\nfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAh,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman sadly, \\u201cI wish I had a heart to beat.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of\\r\\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\\r\\nto ride on the Lion\\u2019s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner\\r\\nthe farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon\\r\\na broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of\\r\\nthe water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a\\r\\nbeautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and\\r\\nall the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They\\r\\nwere greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow shall we cross the river?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is easily done,\\u201d replied the Scarecrow. \\u201cThe Tin Woodman must\\r\\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\\r\\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the\\r\\nriverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had\\r\\neaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe\\r\\nfruit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\\r\\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.\\r\\nSo they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\\r\\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\\r\\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter VIII\\r\\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and\\r\\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\\r\\nplums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest\\r\\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\\r\\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\\r\\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.\\r\\nBut the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\\r\\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\\r\\nto start. Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\\r\\nher arms. When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly,\\r\\nfor he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood\\r\\nupon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands\\r\\nto push the raft through the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\\r\\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\\r\\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep\\r\\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is bad,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \\u201cfor if we cannot get to the land\\r\\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\r\\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd then I should get no brains,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I should get no courage,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I should get no heart,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I should never get back to Kansas,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\\u201d the Scarecrow\\r\\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\\r\\nthe mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\\r\\nagain\\u2014or let go\\u2014the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\\r\\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood-bye!\\u201d he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\r\\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\\r\\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy\\u2019s apron.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\\u201d he thought. \\u201cThen,\\r\\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\\r\\nthe crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\\r\\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never\\r\\nhave any brains, after all!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\\r\\nbehind. Then the Lion said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSomething must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\\r\\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\\r\\ntail.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\\r\\nhis tail. Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\\r\\nshore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\\r\\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman\\u2019s\\r\\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\\r\\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\\r\\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\\r\\nEmerald City.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall we do now?\\u201d asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\\r\\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must get back to the road, in some way,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\\r\\nroad again,\\u201d remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\\r\\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\\r\\ncarried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit\\r\\ntrees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for\\r\\nthe poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\\r\\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\\r\\n\\u201cLook!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\\r\\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat can we do to save him?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.\\r\\nSo they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\\r\\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\\r\\nwater\\u2019s edge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho are you and where are you going?\\u201d asked the Stork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Dorothy,\\u201d answered the girl, \\u201cand these are my friends, the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis isn\\u2019t the road,\\u201d said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\\r\\nlooked sharply at the queer party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know it,\\u201d returned Dorothy, \\u201cbut we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\\r\\nwondering how we shall get him again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere is he?\\u201d asked the Stork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOver there in the river,\\u201d answered the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf he wasn\\u2019t so big and heavy I would get him for you,\\u201d remarked the\\r\\nStork.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe isn\\u2019t heavy a bit,\\u201d said Dorothy eagerly, \\u201cfor he is stuffed with\\r\\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\\r\\nand ever so much.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll try,\\u201d said the Stork, \\u201cbut if I find he is too heavy to\\r\\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\\r\\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her\\r\\ngreat claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\\r\\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\\r\\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\\r\\nwalked along he sang \\u201cTol-de-ri-de-oh!\\u201d at every step, he felt so gay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,\\u201d he said,\\r\\n\\u201cbut the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\\r\\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s all right,\\u201d said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.\\r\\n\\u201cI always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my\\r\\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\\r\\nCity and that Oz will help you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\\r\\nand was soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored\\r\\nbirds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that\\r\\nthe ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and\\r\\nblue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\\r\\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy\\u2019s eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAren\\u2019t they beautiful?\\u201d the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\\r\\nscent of the bright flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI suppose so,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \\u201cWhen I have brains, I shall\\r\\nprobably like them better.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf I only had a heart, I should love them,\\u201d added the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI always did like flowers,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cThey seem so helpless and\\r\\nfrail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\\r\\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\\r\\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when\\r\\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\\r\\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\\r\\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But\\r\\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\\r\\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\\r\\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\\u201d\\r\\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking until\\r\\nDorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\\r\\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall we do?\\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf we leave her here she will die,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cThe smell of the\\r\\nflowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and\\r\\nthe dog is asleep already.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\\r\\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRun fast,\\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \\u201cand get out of this deadly\\r\\nflower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us,\\r\\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.\\r\\nIn a moment he was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\nSo they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy\\u2019s lap, and then they\\r\\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\\r\\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\\r\\nflowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of\\r\\nthe river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\\r\\nasleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge\\r\\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\\r\\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\\r\\nbeautiful green fields before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe can do nothing for him,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \\u201cfor he is\\r\\nmuch too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and\\r\\nperhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d said the Scarecrow. \\u201cThe Lion was a very good comrade for\\r\\none so cowardly. But let us go on.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\\r\\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\\r\\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\\r\\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter IX\\r\\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\\u201d remarked the\\r\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \\u201cfor we have come nearly as far\\r\\nas the river carried us away.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\\r\\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange\\r\\nbeast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great\\r\\nyellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something,\\r\\nfor its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open,\\r\\nshowing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of\\r\\nfire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running before the\\r\\nbeast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he\\r\\nknew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\\r\\nharmless creature.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\\r\\nquick blow that cut the beast\\u2019s head clean off from its body, and it\\r\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\r\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t speak of it, I beg of you,\\u201d replied the Woodman. \\u201cI have no\\r\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\r\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOnly a mouse!\\u201d cried the little animal, indignantly. \\u201cWhy, I am a\\r\\nQueen\\u2014the Queen of all the Field Mice!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, indeed,\\u201d said the Woodman, making a bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTherefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\r\\nsaving my life,\\u201d added the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\r\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage\\r\\nto escape the great Wildcat?\\u201d They all bowed so low to the little Queen\\r\\nthat they almost stood upon their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis funny tin man,\\u201d she answered, \\u201ckilled the Wildcat and saved my\\r\\nlife. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\\r\\nwish.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe will!\\u201d cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\\r\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\\r\\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\\r\\nright into the middle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice\\r\\nwhen he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\\r\\nwhile he called to the mice, \\u201cCome back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt\\r\\nyou.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a\\r\\nclump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, \\u201cAre you sure he will not\\r\\nbite us?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will not let him,\\u201d said the Woodman; \\u201cso do not be afraid.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\\r\\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman\\u2019s arms, and would have\\r\\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one\\r\\nof the biggest mice spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs there anything we can do,\\u201d it asked, \\u201cto repay you for saving the\\r\\nlife of our Queen?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNothing that I know of,\\u201d answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who\\r\\nhad been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed\\r\\nwith straw, said, quickly, \\u201cOh, yes; you can save our friend, the\\r\\nCowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA Lion!\\u201d cried the little Queen. \\u201cWhy, he would eat us all up.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no,\\u201d declared the Scarecrow; \\u201cthis Lion is a coward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cReally?\\u201d asked the Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe says so himself,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow, \\u201cand he would never hurt\\r\\nanyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise\\r\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d said the Queen, \\u201cwe trust you. But what shall we do?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\r\\nobey you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes; there are thousands,\\u201d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\r\\none bring a long piece of string.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\r\\nonce and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran\\r\\naway in every direction as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow,\\u201d said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \\u201cyou must go to those\\r\\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\\r\\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\\r\\nthe leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\\r\\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast\\r\\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\\r\\ntruck was all ready for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\r\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\r\\npiece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\r\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to\\r\\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\r\\naround and looking at her timidly. But the Scarecrow told her about\\r\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPermit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\\r\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\r\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied\\r\\naround the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course\\r\\nthe truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to\\r\\ndraw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to\\r\\npull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman could sit\\r\\non it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place\\r\\nwhere the Lion lay asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\r\\nto get him up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\r\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\\r\\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\r\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\r\\nfrom behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out\\r\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\r\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\\r\\nher companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was\\r\\nglad he had been rescued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\r\\nthrough the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to\\r\\nleave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf ever you need us again,\\u201d she said, \\u201ccome out into the field and\\r\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood-bye!\\u201d they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\r\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she\\r\\nate for her dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter X\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\\r\\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\\r\\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\\r\\nto find himself still alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI ran as fast as I could,\\u201d he said, sitting down and yawning, \\u201cbut the\\r\\nflowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved\\r\\nhim from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\\r\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\\r\\nmice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what\\r\\nshall we do now?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\\u201d said\\r\\nDorothy, \\u201cand then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\\r\\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\\r\\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road\\r\\nof yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the\\r\\nGreat Oz dwelt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\\r\\nbeautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\\r\\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.\\r\\nOnce more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were\\r\\npainted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer\\r\\nevidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of\\r\\nthese houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the\\r\\ndoors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no\\r\\none came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of\\r\\nwhich they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in\\r\\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\\r\\nthose of the Munchkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis must be the Land of Oz,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cand we are surely getting\\r\\nnear the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d answered the Scarecrow. \\u201cEverything is green here, while in the\\r\\ncountry of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do\\r\\nnot seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I\\u2019m afraid we shall be\\r\\nunable to find a place to pass the night.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI should like something to eat besides fruit,\\u201d said the girl, \\u201cand I\\u2019m\\r\\nsure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to\\r\\nthe people.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\\r\\nto the door and knocked.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, \\u201cWhat do you\\r\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\\u201d answered\\r\\nDorothy; \\u201cand the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\\r\\nfor the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs he tame?\\u201d asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes,\\u201d said the girl, \\u201cand he is a great coward, too. He will be\\r\\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\\r\\nat the Lion, \\u201cif that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\\r\\nsome supper and a place to sleep.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\r\\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\r\\ncouch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\r\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere are you all going?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTo the Emerald City,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cto see the Great Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, indeed!\\u201d exclaimed the man. \\u201cAre you sure that Oz will see you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I\\r\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\r\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\r\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDoes he never go out?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNever. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\\r\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is he like?\\u201d asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is hard to tell,\\u201d said the man thoughtfully. \\u201cYou see, Oz is a\\r\\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\r\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\\r\\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\\r\\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\\r\\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is very strange,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cbut we must try, in some way, to\\r\\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\\u201d asked the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI want him to give me some brains,\\u201d said the Scarecrow eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, Oz could do that easily enough,\\u201d declared the man. \\u201cHe has more\\r\\nbrains than he needs.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I want him to give me a heart,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat will not trouble him,\\u201d continued the man, \\u201cfor Oz has a large\\r\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I want him to give me courage,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\\u201d said the man,\\r\\n\\u201cwhich he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\r\\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I want him to send me back to Kansas,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere is Kansas?\\u201d asked the man, with surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know,\\u201d replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \\u201cbut it is my home, and\\r\\nI\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s somewhere.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\r\\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\\r\\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\\r\\nusually has his own way. But what do YOU want?\\u201d he continued, speaking\\r\\nto Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\\r\\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\\r\\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.\\r\\nThe Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\\r\\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all. Toto ate a little of\\r\\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\\r\\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\\r\\ndisturbed. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\\r\\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,\\r\\nand soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat must be the Emerald City,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\\r\\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it\\r\\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\\r\\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\\r\\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\\r\\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\\r\\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\\r\\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\\r\\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\\r\\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\\r\\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \\u201cWhat do you wish\\r\\nin the Emerald City?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe came here to see the Great Oz,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\\u201d he said,\\r\\nshaking his head in perplexity. \\u201cHe is powerful and terrible, and if\\r\\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\\r\\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\\u201d replied the\\r\\nScarecrow; \\u201cit is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\\r\\nWizard.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSo he is,\\u201d said the green man, \\u201cand he rules the Emerald City wisely\\r\\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\r\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\\r\\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\\r\\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\\r\\nspectacles.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\\r\\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\\r\\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\\r\\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\\r\\nthem.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\\r\\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\\r\\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\\r\\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\\r\\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\\r\\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\\r\\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\\r\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\\r\\nwith the key.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\\r\\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\\r\\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\\r\\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XI\\r\\nThe Wonderful City of Oz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her\\r\\nfriends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City.\\r\\nThe streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\\r\\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a\\r\\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\\r\\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\\r\\nbrightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the\\r\\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were\\r\\ngreen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were many people\\u2014men, women, and children\\u2014walking about, and\\r\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They\\r\\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\\r\\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\\r\\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the\\r\\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green. Green candy\\r\\nand green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green\\r\\nhats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling\\r\\ngreen lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that\\r\\nthey paid for it with green pennies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\\r\\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.\\r\\nEveryone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came\\r\\nto a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the\\r\\nPalace of Oz, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door,\\r\\ndressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere are strangers,\\u201d said the Guardian of the Gates to him, \\u201cand they\\r\\ndemand to see the Great Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStep inside,\\u201d answered the soldier, \\u201cand I will carry your message to\\r\\nhim.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room\\r\\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The\\r\\nsoldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering\\r\\nthis room, and when they were seated he said politely:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPlease make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\\r\\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at\\r\\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHave you seen Oz?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no,\\u201d returned the soldier; \\u201cI have never seen him. But I spoke to\\r\\nhim as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he\\r\\nwill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must\\r\\nenter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.\\r\\nTherefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will\\r\\nhave you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\\r\\njourney.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d replied the girl; \\u201cthat is very kind of Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\\r\\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely\\r\\ngreen hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she\\r\\nsaid, \\u201cFollow me and I will show you your room.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the\\r\\ndog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up\\r\\nthree flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the\\r\\nPalace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft\\r\\ncomfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet\\r\\ncounterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\\r\\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\\r\\nbeautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in\\r\\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\\r\\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\\r\\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\\r\\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMake yourself perfectly at home,\\u201d said the green girl, \\u201cand if you\\r\\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\\r\\nmorning.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\\r\\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\\r\\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\\r\\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\\r\\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\\r\\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\\r\\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\\r\\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\\r\\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\\r\\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\\r\\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\\r\\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\\r\\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\\r\\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\\r\\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\\r\\nhimself asleep in a minute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\\r\\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\\r\\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\r\\ngreen ribbon around Toto\\u2019s neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\r\\nof the Great Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\\r\\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\\r\\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\\r\\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\\r\\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\\r\\nwhispered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOf course,\\u201d answered the girl, \\u201cif he will see me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, he will see you,\\u201d said the soldier who had taken her message to\\r\\nthe Wizard, \\u201calthough he does not like to have people ask to see him.\\r\\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\\r\\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\\r\\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\\r\\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\\r\\npresence.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \\u201cThat is the\\r\\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\r\\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\\r\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\r\\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\\r\\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\\r\\nwonderful manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\r\\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\\r\\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\\r\\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\\r\\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\\r\\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\\r\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\\r\\nDorothy heard a voice say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\\r\\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere did you get the silver shoes?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\\r\\nher and killed her,\\u201d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere did you get the mark upon your forehead?\\u201d continued the voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\r\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\\u201d said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\\r\\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \\u201cWhat do you wish me to do?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSend me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\\u201d she\\r\\nanswered earnestly. \\u201cI don\\u2019t like your country, although it is so\\r\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\r\\nbeing away so long.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\r\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\r\\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\\u201d asked Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\\r\\nand I am only a little girl.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\\u201d said\\r\\nOz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat just happened,\\u201d returned Dorothy simply; \\u201cI could not help it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said the Head, \\u201cI will give you my answer. You have no right to\\r\\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\\r\\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\\r\\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\\r\\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat must I do?\\u201d asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cKill the Wicked Witch of the West,\\u201d answered Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I cannot!\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\r\\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\\r\\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\\r\\nKansas\\u2014but not before.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\r\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\r\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI never killed anything, willingly,\\u201d she sobbed. \\u201cEven if I wanted to,\\r\\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\\r\\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI do not know,\\u201d said the Head; \\u201cbut that is my answer, and until the\\r\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\\r\\nthat the Witch is Wicked\\u2014tremendously Wicked\\u2014and ought to be killed.\\r\\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\\r\\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\\r\\nsaid to her. \\u201cThere is no hope for me,\\u201d she said sadly, \\u201cfor Oz will\\r\\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and\\r\\nthat I can never do.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy\\r\\nwent to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to\\r\\nsleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the\\r\\nScarecrow and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome with me, for Oz has sent for you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\\r\\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.\\r\\nShe was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green\\r\\nlocks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings,\\r\\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\\r\\nbreath of air reached them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\\r\\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\\r\\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\\r\\nand I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead\\r\\nof straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your\\r\\ndominions.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy should I do this for you?\\u201d asked the Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,\\u201d\\r\\nanswered the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI never grant favors without some return,\\u201d said Oz; \\u201cbut this much I\\r\\nwill promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\\r\\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\\r\\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, in\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSo I did. I don\\u2019t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not\\r\\ngrant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned\\r\\nthe brains you so greatly desire.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what\\r\\nOz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard\\r\\nwas not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll the same,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cshe needs a heart as much as the\\r\\nTin Woodman.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOz has sent for you. Follow me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He\\r\\ndid not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he\\r\\nhoped it would be the lovely Lady. \\u201cFor,\\u201d he said to himself, \\u201cif it is\\r\\nthe head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no\\r\\nheart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the\\r\\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\\r\\nsaid to be kindly hearted.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\\r\\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.\\r\\nIt was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\\r\\nstrong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a\\r\\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long\\r\\narms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.\\r\\nThick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\\r\\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\\r\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\\r\\nand fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\\r\\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\\u201d spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\\r\\none great roar. \\u201cWho are you, and why do you seek me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\\r\\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy should I do this?\\u201d demanded the Beast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\\u201d answered the\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \\u201cIf you indeed desire a\\r\\nheart, you must earn it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow?\\u201d asked the Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHelp Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\\u201d replied the Beast.\\r\\n\\u201cWhen the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\r\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\\r\\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly\\r\\nat the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the\\r\\nLion said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\r\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely\\r\\nLady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my\\r\\nbidding. And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I\\r\\nwill roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us\\r\\nwhat we desire. So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be\\r\\nwell.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to\\r\\nthe great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to\\r\\nhis surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and\\r\\nglowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was\\r\\nthat Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he\\r\\ntried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his\\r\\nwhiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the\\r\\nwords it spoke:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Lion answered, \\u201cI am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I\\r\\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may\\r\\nbecome the King of Beasts, as men call me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy should I give you courage?\\u201d demanded Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\\r\\ngrant my request,\\u201d answered the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, \\u201cBring\\r\\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\\r\\ncourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and\\r\\nwhile he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so\\r\\nfuriously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad\\r\\nto find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible\\r\\ninterview with the Wizard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall we do now?\\u201d asked Dorothy sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere is only one thing we can do,\\u201d returned the Lion, \\u201cand that is to\\r\\ngo to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy\\r\\nher.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut suppose we cannot?\\u201d said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen I shall never have courage,\\u201d declared the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall never have brains,\\u201d added the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall never have a heart,\\u201d spoke the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,\\u201d said Dorothy,\\r\\nbeginning to cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBe careful!\\u201d cried the green girl. \\u201cThe tears will fall on your green\\r\\nsilk gown and spot it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, \\u201cI suppose we must try it; but I am\\r\\nsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will go with you; but I\\u2019m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,\\u201d\\r\\nsaid the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will go too,\\u201d declared the Scarecrow; \\u201cbut I shall not be of much\\r\\nhelp to you, I am such a fool.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI haven\\u2019t the heart to harm even a Witch,\\u201d remarked the Tin Woodman;\\r\\n\\u201cbut if you go I certainly shall go with you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,\\r\\nand the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his\\r\\njoints properly oiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw\\r\\nand Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better. The\\r\\ngreen girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy\\u2019s basket with\\r\\ngood things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto\\u2019s neck with\\r\\na green ribbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when\\r\\nthey were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the\\r\\nback yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a\\r\\ngreen egg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XII\\r\\nThe Search for the Wicked Witch\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the\\r\\nEmerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the\\r\\nGates lived. This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in\\r\\nhis great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhich road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere is no road,\\u201d answered the Guardian of the Gates. \\u201cNo one ever\\r\\nwishes to go that way.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow, then, are we to find her?\\u201d inquired the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat will be easy,\\u201d replied the man, \\u201cfor when she knows you are in\\r\\nthe country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her\\r\\nslaves.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerhaps not,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cfor we mean to destroy her.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, that is different,\\u201d said the Guardian of the Gates. \\u201cNo one has\\r\\never destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves\\r\\nof you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and\\r\\nfierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where\\r\\nthe sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,\\r\\nwalking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies\\r\\nand buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on\\r\\nin the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer\\r\\ngreen, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto\\u2019s neck had also lost its\\r\\ngreen color and was as white as Dorothy\\u2019s dress.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground\\r\\nbecame rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this\\r\\ncountry of the West, and the ground was untilled.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no\\r\\ntrees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and\\r\\nthe Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with\\r\\nthe Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as\\r\\npowerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in\\r\\nthe door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy\\r\\nlying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance\\r\\noff, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she\\r\\nblew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great\\r\\nwolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo to those people,\\u201d said the Witch, \\u201cand tear them to pieces.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre you not going to make them your slaves?\\u201d asked the leader of the\\r\\nwolves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo,\\u201d she answered, \\u201cone is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and\\r\\nanother a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into\\r\\nsmall pieces.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed\\r\\nby the others.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard\\r\\nthe wolves coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is my fight,\\u201d said the Woodman, \\u201cso get behind me and I will meet\\r\\nthem as they come.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of\\r\\nthe wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf\\u2019s\\r\\nhead from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could\\r\\nraise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp\\r\\nedge of the Tin Woodman\\u2019s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty\\r\\ntimes a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap\\r\\nbefore the Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, \\u201cIt\\r\\nwas a good fight, friend.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was\\r\\nquite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the\\r\\nTin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down\\r\\nto breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle\\r\\nand looked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her\\r\\nwolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her\\r\\ncountry. This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver\\r\\nwhistle twice.\\r\\n\\r\\nStraightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough\\r\\nto darken the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, \\u201cFly at once to the\\r\\nstrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her\\r\\ncompanions. When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow said, \\u201cThis is my battle, so lie down beside me and\\r\\nyou will not be harmed.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up\\r\\nand stretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were\\r\\nfrightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare\\r\\nto come any nearer. But the King Crow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and\\r\\ntwisted its neck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow twisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty\\r\\ntimes the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead\\r\\nbeside him. Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they\\r\\nwent upon their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a\\r\\nheap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her\\r\\nsilver whistle.\\r\\n\\r\\nForthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of\\r\\nblack bees came flying toward her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo to the strangers and sting them to death!\\u201d commanded the Witch, and\\r\\nthe bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and\\r\\nher friends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the\\r\\nScarecrow had decided what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and\\r\\nthe Lion,\\u201d he said to the Woodman, \\u201cand the bees cannot sting them.\\u201d\\r\\nThis the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held\\r\\nToto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew\\r\\nat him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting\\r\\nthe Woodman at all. And as bees cannot live when their stings are\\r\\nbroken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick\\r\\nabout the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman\\r\\nput the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as\\r\\never. So they started upon their journey once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little\\r\\nheaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and\\r\\ngnashed her teeth. And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were\\r\\nthe Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the\\r\\nstrangers and destroy them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were\\r\\ntold. So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the\\r\\nLion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies\\r\\nwere so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a\\r\\nstrap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to\\r\\nthink what she should do next. She could not understand how all her\\r\\nplans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful\\r\\nWitch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to\\r\\nact.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and\\r\\nrubies running round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it\\r\\ncould call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any\\r\\norder they were given. But no person could command these strange\\r\\ncreatures more than three times. Twice already the Wicked Witch had\\r\\nused the charm of the Cap. Once was when she had made the Winkies her\\r\\nslaves, and set herself to rule over their country. The Winged Monkeys\\r\\nhad helped her do this. The second time was when she had fought against\\r\\nthe Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the West. The\\r\\nWinged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more could\\r\\nshe use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so\\r\\nuntil all her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce\\r\\nwolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her\\r\\nslaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was\\r\\nonly one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it\\r\\nupon her head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEp-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNext she stood upon her right foot and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cZiz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling\\r\\nsound was heard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great\\r\\nchattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show\\r\\nthe Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of\\r\\nimmense and powerful wings on his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew\\r\\nclose to the Witch and said, \\u201cYou have called us for the third and last\\r\\ntime. What do you command?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except\\r\\nthe Lion,\\u201d said the Wicked Witch. \\u201cBring that beast to me, for I have a\\r\\nmind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYour commands shall be obeyed,\\u201d said the leader. Then, with a great\\r\\ndeal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place\\r\\nwhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the\\r\\nair until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.\\r\\nHere they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the\\r\\nrocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move\\r\\nnor groan.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers\\r\\npulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat\\r\\nand boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top\\r\\nbranches of a tall tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and\\r\\nwound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable\\r\\nto bite or scratch or struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and\\r\\nflew away with him to the Witch\\u2019s castle, where he was placed in a\\r\\nsmall yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not\\r\\nescape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,\\r\\nwatching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her\\r\\nturn. The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy\\r\\narms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the\\r\\nmark of the Good Witch\\u2019s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short,\\r\\nmotioning the others not to touch her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe dare not harm this little girl,\\u201d he said to them, \\u201cfor she is\\r\\nprotected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of\\r\\nEvil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch\\r\\nand leave her there.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried\\r\\nher swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they\\r\\nset her down upon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the\\r\\nWitch:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The\\r\\nlittle girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your\\r\\npower over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and\\r\\nnoise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark\\r\\non Dorothy\\u2019s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked\\r\\ndown at Dorothy\\u2019s feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble\\r\\nwith fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At\\r\\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\\r\\nto look into the child\\u2019s eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\\r\\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\\r\\nSilver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\r\\nthought, \\u201cI can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\r\\nuse her power.\\u201d Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\\r\\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\r\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\r\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\r\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\\r\\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\r\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\\r\\ngo to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\\r\\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\\r\\nshut the gate again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf I cannot harness you,\\u201d said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\\r\\nthe bars of the gate, \\u201cI can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat\\r\\nuntil you do as I wish.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\r\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, \\u201cAre you ready to be harnessed\\r\\nlike a horse?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Lion would answer, \\u201cNo. If you come in this yard, I will bite\\r\\nyou.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\r\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\\r\\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\\r\\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\\r\\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\\r\\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\\r\\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\\r\\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\r\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\r\\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\\r\\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full\\r\\nof fear for herself and Toto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with\\r\\nher umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg in\\r\\nreturn. The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was so\\r\\nwicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy\\u2019s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would\\r\\nbe harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes\\r\\nshe would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and\\r\\nlooking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for\\r\\nhis little mistress. Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas\\r\\nor the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the\\r\\nlittle girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver\\r\\nShoes which the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves\\r\\nwere lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of\\r\\nthe Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,\\r\\nthey would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.\\r\\nShe watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,\\r\\nthinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty\\r\\nshoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took\\r\\nher bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in\\r\\nDorothy\\u2019s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was\\r\\ngreater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy\\r\\nwas bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let\\r\\nwater touch her in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\\r\\ntrick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in\\r\\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\\r\\niron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the\\r\\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\\r\\nfull length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\\r\\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\\r\\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\\r\\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\\r\\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\\r\\nto do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\\r\\nangry, and said to the Witch, \\u201cGive me back my shoe!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will not,\\u201d retorted the Witch, \\u201cfor it is now my shoe, and not\\r\\nyours.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou are a wicked creature!\\u201d cried Dorothy. \\u201cYou have no right to take\\r\\nmy shoe from me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI shall keep it, just the same,\\u201d said the Witch, laughing at her, \\u201cand\\r\\nsomeday I shall get the other one from you, too.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water\\r\\nthat stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as\\r\\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSee what you have done!\\u201d she screamed. \\u201cIn a minute I shall melt\\r\\naway.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m very sorry, indeed,\\u201d said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see\\r\\nthe Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDidn\\u2019t you know water would be the end of me?\\u201d asked the Witch, in a\\r\\nwailing, despairing voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOf course not,\\u201d answered Dorothy. \\u201cHow should I?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\r\\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a\\r\\nlittle girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked\\r\\ndeeds. Look out\\u2014here I go!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass\\r\\nand began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing\\r\\nthat she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket\\r\\nof water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the\\r\\ndoor. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of\\r\\nthe old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her\\r\\nfoot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to\\r\\nthe courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had\\r\\ncome to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange\\r\\nland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIII\\r\\nThe Rescue\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had\\r\\nbeen melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate\\r\\nof his prison and set him free. They went in together to the castle,\\r\\nwhere Dorothy\\u2019s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell\\r\\nthem that they were no longer slaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been\\r\\nmade to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had\\r\\nalways treated them with great cruelty. They kept this day as a\\r\\nholiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\\r\\ndancing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,\\u201d\\r\\nsaid the Lion, \\u201cI should be quite happy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t you suppose we could rescue them?\\u201d asked the girl anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe can try,\\u201d answered the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to\\r\\nrescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted\\r\\nto do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from\\r\\nbondage. So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they\\r\\nknew the most, and they all started away. They traveled that day and\\r\\npart of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin\\r\\nWoodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him, but the blade\\r\\nwas rusted and the handle broken off short.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to\\r\\nthe Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the\\r\\nsad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.\\r\\nWhen they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre any of your people tinsmiths?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,\\u201d they told her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen bring them to me,\\u201d she said. And when the tinsmiths came,\\r\\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, \\u201cCan you\\r\\nstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into\\r\\nshape again, and solder him together where he is broken?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that\\r\\nthey thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So\\r\\nthey set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\\r\\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\\r\\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\\r\\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\\r\\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To be sure, there\\r\\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\\r\\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy\\u2019s room and thanked her for\\r\\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy\\r\\nhad to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his\\r\\njoints would not be rusted. At the same time her own tears fell thick\\r\\nand fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears\\r\\ndid not need to be wiped away. As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so\\r\\noften with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was\\r\\nobliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it\\r\\ndried.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf we only had the Scarecrow with us again,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, \\u201cI\\r\\nshould be quite happy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must try to find him,\\u201d said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and\\r\\npart of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of\\r\\nwhich the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow\\u2019s clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could\\r\\nclimb it; but the Woodman said at once, \\u201cI\\u2019ll chop it down, and then we\\r\\ncan get the Scarecrow\\u2019s clothes.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,\\r\\nanother of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of\\r\\nsolid gold and fitted it to the Woodman\\u2019s axe, instead of the old\\r\\nbroken handle. Others polished the blade until all the rust was removed\\r\\nand it glistened like burnished silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short\\r\\ntime the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow\\u2019s clothes\\r\\nfell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the\\r\\ncastle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!\\r\\nhere was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over\\r\\nagain for saving him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy\\r\\ndays at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to\\r\\nmake them comfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, \\u201cWe must go back to\\r\\nOz, and claim his promise.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said the Woodman, \\u201cat last I shall get my heart.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall get my brains,\\u201d added the Scarecrow joyfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall get my courage,\\u201d said the Lion thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I shall get back to Kansas,\\u201d cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.\\r\\n\\u201cOh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together\\r\\nand bade them good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and\\r\\nthey had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay\\r\\nand rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West. Finding they were\\r\\ndetermined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden\\r\\ncollar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with\\r\\ndiamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,\\r\\nto keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a\\r\\nsilver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,\\r\\nand all shook hands with them until their arms ached.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy went to the Witch\\u2019s cupboard to fill her basket with food for\\r\\nthe journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own\\r\\nhead and found that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything\\r\\nabout the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so\\r\\nshe made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald\\r\\nCity; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to\\r\\ncarry with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIV\\r\\nThe Winged Monkeys\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will remember there was no road\\u2014not even a pathway\\u2014between the\\r\\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four\\r\\ntravelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so\\r\\nsent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her. It was much harder to\\r\\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\\r\\ndaisies than it was being carried. They knew, of course, they must go\\r\\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\\r\\nway. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\\r\\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\\r\\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night\\r\\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\\r\\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\\u2014all but the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\\r\\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf we walk far enough,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cI am sure we shall sometime\\r\\ncome to some place.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\\r\\nthe scarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe have surely lost our way,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand unless we find it again in\\r\\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNor I my heart,\\u201d declared the Tin Woodman. \\u201cIt seems to me I can\\r\\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\\r\\njourney.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou see,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t the\\r\\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\\r\\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\\r\\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\\r\\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\\r\\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSuppose we call the field mice,\\u201d she suggested. \\u201cThey could probably\\r\\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTo be sure they could,\\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t we think of\\r\\nthat before?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\\r\\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they\\r\\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\\r\\nrunning up to her. Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\\r\\nsqueaky little voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat can I do for my friends?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe have lost our way,\\u201d said Dorothy. \\u201cCan you tell us where the\\r\\nEmerald City is?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCertainly,\\u201d answered the Queen; \\u201cbut it is a great way off, for you\\r\\nhave had it at your backs all this time.\\u201d Then she noticed Dorothy\\u2019s\\r\\nGolden Cap, and said, \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you use the charm of the Cap, and call\\r\\nthe Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City of Oz in\\r\\nless than an hour.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know there was a charm,\\u201d answered Dorothy, in surprise. \\u201cWhat\\r\\nis it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is written inside the Golden Cap,\\u201d replied the Queen of the Mice.\\r\\n\\u201cBut if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\\r\\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWon\\u2019t they hurt me?\\u201d asked the girl anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!\\u201d And she\\r\\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\\r\\nthe lining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\\r\\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEp-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\\u201d she said, standing on her left foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat did you say?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\\r\\ndoing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\\u201d Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\\r\\nright foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHello!\\u201d replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cZiz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\\u201d said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.\\r\\nThis ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\\r\\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, \\u201cWhat is your command?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe wish to go to the Emerald City,\\u201d said the child, \\u201cand we have lost\\r\\nour way.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe will carry you,\\u201d replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\\r\\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\\r\\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\\r\\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\\r\\nbite him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\\r\\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\\r\\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\\r\\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\\r\\nwoods far below them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,\\r\\none of them the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and\\r\\nwere careful not to hurt her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\\u201d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is a long story,\\u201d answered the King, with a winged laugh; \\u201cbut as\\r\\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\\r\\nabout it, if you wish.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI shall be glad to hear it,\\u201d she replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOnce,\\u201d began the leader, \\u201cwe were a free people, living happily in the\\r\\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\\r\\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\\r\\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\\r\\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\\r\\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\\r\\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\\r\\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\\r\\nland.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\\r\\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\\r\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\\r\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\r\\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\r\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\r\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\\r\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\\r\\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\r\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\\r\\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\\r\\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\\r\\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\\r\\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\\r\\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\r\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette\\u2019s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\r\\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\\r\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\\r\\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\\r\\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\\r\\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\\r\\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\\r\\ndropped him into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Swim out, my fine fellow,\\u2019 cried my grandfather, \\u2018and see if the\\r\\nwater has spotted your clothes.\\u2019 Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\\r\\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\r\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\\r\\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\r\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\\r\\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\\r\\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\r\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\\r\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\r\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\r\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\r\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\\r\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\r\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\r\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\\r\\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\r\\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what became of them?\\u201d asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\r\\ninterested in the story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,\\u201d replied the Monkey,\\r\\n\\u201che was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could not\\r\\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\\r\\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\\r\\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\\r\\nwere all afraid of her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\\r\\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\\r\\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the\\r\\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\\r\\nwishes upon us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\\r\\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at\\r\\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The\\r\\nstrange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate of\\r\\nthe City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\\r\\nfollowed by all his band.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat was a good ride,\\u201d said the little girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, and a quick way out of our troubles,\\u201d replied the Lion. \\u201cHow\\r\\nlucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XV\\r\\nThe Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang\\r\\nthe bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates they had met before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat! are you back again?\\u201d he asked, in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you not see us?\\u201d answered the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe did visit her,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd she let you go again?\\u201d asked the man, in wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShe could not help it, for she is melted,\\u201d explained the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMelted! Well, that is good news, indeed,\\u201d said the man. \\u201cWho melted\\r\\nher?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was Dorothy,\\u201d said the Lion gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood gracious!\\u201d exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from\\r\\nthe great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward\\r\\nthey passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people\\r\\nheard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked\\r\\nWitch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed\\r\\nthem in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,\\r\\nbut he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful\\r\\ngreen girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they\\r\\nmight rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\\r\\nother travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;\\r\\nbut Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them\\r\\nat once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor\\r\\nthe next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at\\r\\nlast they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\\r\\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow\\r\\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\\r\\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\\r\\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\\r\\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\\r\\nnine o\\u2019clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\\r\\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift\\r\\nOz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and\\r\\nthen she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how\\r\\nglad she was to have her little girl at home again.\\r\\n\\r\\nPromptly at nine o\\u2019clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\\r\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room\\r\\nof the Great Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he\\r\\nhad taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about\\r\\nand saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and\\r\\ncloser to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more\\r\\ndreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere\\r\\nnear the top of the great dome, and it said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\\r\\nDorothy asked, \\u201cWhere are you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am everywhere,\\u201d answered the Voice, \\u201cbut to the eyes of common\\r\\nmortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you\\r\\nmay converse with me.\\u201d Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\\r\\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in\\r\\na row while Dorothy said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe have come to claim our promise, O Oz.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat promise?\\u201d asked Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\\r\\ndestroyed,\\u201d said the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd you promised to give me brains,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd you promised to give me a heart,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd you promised to give me courage,\\u201d said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs the Wicked Witch really destroyed?\\u201d asked the Voice, and Dorothy\\r\\nthought it trembled a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d she answered, \\u201cI melted her with a bucket of water.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDear me,\\u201d said the Voice, \\u201chow sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for\\r\\nI must have time to think it over.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019ve had plenty of time already,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe shan\\u2019t wait a day longer,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou must keep your promises to us!\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave\\r\\na large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped\\r\\naway from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a\\r\\ncorner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\\r\\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in\\r\\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\\r\\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\\r\\ncried out, \\u201cWho are you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\\u201d said the little man, in a trembling\\r\\nvoice. \\u201cBut don\\u2019t strike me\\u2014please don\\u2019t\\u2014and I\\u2019ll do anything you want\\r\\nme to.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought Oz was a great Head,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\\u201d exclaimed the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, you are all wrong,\\u201d said the little man meekly. \\u201cI have been\\r\\nmaking believe.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMaking believe!\\u201d cried Dorothy. \\u201cAre you not a Great Wizard?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHush, my dear,\\u201d he said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t speak so loud, or you will be\\r\\noverheard\\u2014and I should be ruined. I\\u2019m supposed to be a Great Wizard.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd aren\\u2019t you?\\u201d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot a bit of it, my dear; I\\u2019m just a common man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou\\u2019re more than that,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \\u201cyou\\u2019re\\r\\na humbug.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cExactly so!\\u201d declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\\r\\nit pleased him. \\u201cI am a humbug.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut this is terrible,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \\u201cHow shall I ever get my\\r\\nheart?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOr I my courage?\\u201d asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOr I my brains?\\u201d wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\\r\\nwith his coat sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy dear friends,\\u201d said Oz, \\u201cI pray you not to speak of these little\\r\\nthings. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I\\u2019m in at being found\\r\\nout.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDoesn\\u2019t anyone else know you\\u2019re a humbug?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo one knows it but you four\\u2014and myself,\\u201d replied Oz. \\u201cI have fooled\\r\\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\\r\\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\\r\\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut, I don\\u2019t understand,\\u201d said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \\u201cHow was it\\r\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat was one of my tricks,\\u201d answered Oz. \\u201cStep this way, please, and I\\r\\nwill tell you all about it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\\r\\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\\r\\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\\r\\npainted face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\\u201d said Oz. \\u201cI stood behind the\\r\\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut how about the voice?\\u201d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I am a ventriloquist,\\u201d said the little man. \\u201cI can throw the sound\\r\\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\\r\\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\\u201d He showed\\r\\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\\r\\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\\r\\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\\r\\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\\r\\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\\r\\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cReally,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cyou ought to be ashamed of yourself for\\r\\nbeing such a humbug.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am\\u2014I certainly am,\\u201d answered the little man sorrowfully; \\u201cbut it was\\r\\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\\r\\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was born in Omaha\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, that isn\\u2019t very far from Kansas!\\u201d cried Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, but it\\u2019s farther from here,\\u201d he said, shaking his head at her\\r\\nsadly. \\u201cWhen I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very\\r\\nwell trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\\r\\nbeast.\\u201d Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\\r\\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \\u201cAfter a time,\\u201d continued\\r\\nOz, \\u201cI tired of that, and became a balloonist.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is that?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\r\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\\u201d he explained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI know.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\r\\nthat I couldn\\u2019t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\\r\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\r\\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\\r\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\\r\\nstrange and beautiful country.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\\r\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\r\\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\\r\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cJust to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\r\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\\r\\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\\r\\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\\r\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut isn\\u2019t everything here green?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo more than in any other city,\\u201d replied Oz; \\u201cbut when you wear green\\r\\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\\r\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\\r\\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\\r\\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\\r\\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\\r\\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\\r\\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\\r\\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\\r\\nup and would not see any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOne of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\r\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\r\\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\\r\\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\\r\\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\\r\\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\\r\\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\\r\\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\\r\\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\\r\\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\\r\\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\\r\\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\\r\\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI think you are a very bad man,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no, my dear; I\\u2019m really a very good man, but I\\u2019m a very bad\\r\\nWizard, I must admit.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019t you give me brains?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\\r\\nbrains, but it doesn\\u2019t know much. Experience is the only thing that\\r\\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\\r\\nyou are sure to get.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat may all be true,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cbut I shall be very\\r\\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d he said with a sigh, \\u201cI\\u2019m not much of a magician, as I said;\\r\\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\\r\\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\\r\\nthat out for yourself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, thank you\\u2014thank you!\\u201d cried the Scarecrow. \\u201cI\\u2019ll find a way to use\\r\\nthem, never fear!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut how about my courage?\\u201d asked the Lion anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou have plenty of courage, I am sure,\\u201d answered Oz. \\u201cAll you need is\\r\\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\\r\\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\\r\\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerhaps I have, but I\\u2019m scared just the same,\\u201d said the Lion. \\u201cI shall\\r\\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\\r\\nmakes one forget he is afraid.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\\u201d replied Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow about my heart?\\u201d asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, as for that,\\u201d answered Oz, \\u201cI think you are wrong to want a\\r\\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\\r\\nluck not to have a heart.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat must be a matter of opinion,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \\u201cFor my part,\\r\\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\\r\\nthe heart.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d answered Oz meekly. \\u201cCome to me tomorrow and you shall\\r\\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\\r\\ncontinue the part a little longer.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd now,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201chow am I to get back to Kansas?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe shall have to think about that,\\u201d replied the little man. \\u201cGive me\\r\\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I\\u2019ll try to find a way to\\r\\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\\r\\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\\r\\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\\r\\nreturn for my help\\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\\r\\none I am a humbug.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\\r\\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that \\u201cThe Great and\\r\\nTerrible Humbug,\\u201d as she called him, would find a way to send her back\\r\\nto Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVI\\r\\nThe Magic Art of the Great Humbug\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCongratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I\\r\\nreturn I shall be as other men are.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have always liked you as you were,\\u201d said Dorothy simply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,\\u201d he replied. \\u201cBut surely you\\r\\nwill think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain\\r\\nis going to turn out.\\u201d Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful\\r\\nvoice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome in,\\u201d said Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the\\r\\nwindow, engaged in deep thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have come for my brains,\\u201d remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,\\u201d replied Oz. \\u201cYou must excuse\\r\\nme for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to put\\r\\nyour brains in their proper place.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s all right,\\u201d said the Scarecrow. \\u201cYou are quite welcome to take\\r\\nmy head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on\\r\\nagain.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he\\r\\nentered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed\\r\\nwith a great many pins and needles. Having shaken them together\\r\\nthoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow\\u2019s head with the mixture\\r\\nand stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had fastened the Scarecrow\\u2019s head on his body again he said to\\r\\nhim, \\u201cHereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\\r\\nbran-new brains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his\\r\\ngreatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his\\r\\nfriends.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the\\r\\ntop with brains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow do you feel?\\u201d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI feel wise indeed,\\u201d he answered earnestly. \\u201cWhen I get used to my\\r\\nbrains I shall know everything.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?\\u201d asked the\\r\\nTin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is proof that he is sharp,\\u201d remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, I must go to Oz and get my heart,\\u201d said the Woodman. So he\\r\\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome in,\\u201d called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, \\u201cI have come\\r\\nfor my heart.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d answered the little man. \\u201cBut I shall have to cut a hole\\r\\nin your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope it\\r\\nwon\\u2019t hurt you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no,\\u201d answered the Woodman. \\u201cI shall not feel it at all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinsmith\\u2019s shears and cut a small, square hole\\r\\nin the left side of the Tin Woodman\\u2019s breast. Then, going to a chest of\\r\\ndrawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed\\r\\nwith sawdust.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it a beauty?\\u201d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is, indeed!\\u201d replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased. \\u201cBut is\\r\\nit a kind heart?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, very!\\u201d answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman\\u2019s breast and\\r\\nthen replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it\\r\\nhad been cut.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere,\\u201d said he; \\u201cnow you have a heart that any man might be proud of.\\r\\nI\\u2019m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn\\u2019t\\r\\nbe helped.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNever mind the patch,\\u201d exclaimed the happy Woodman. \\u201cI am very\\r\\ngrateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t speak of it,\\u201d replied Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy\\r\\non account of his good fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome in,\\u201d said Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have come for my courage,\\u201d announced the Lion, entering the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d answered the little man; \\u201cI will get it for you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a\\r\\nsquare green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold\\r\\ndish, beautifully carved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who\\r\\nsniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDrink.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is it?\\u201d asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d answered Oz, \\u201cif it were inside of you, it would be courage.\\r\\nYou know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this\\r\\nreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore\\r\\nI advise you to drink it as soon as possible.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow do you feel now?\\u201d asked Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFull of courage,\\u201d replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his\\r\\nfriends to tell them of his good fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\nOz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought\\r\\nthey wanted. \\u201cHow can I help being a humbug,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhen all these\\r\\npeople make me do things that everybody knows can\\u2019t be done? It was\\r\\neasy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because\\r\\nthey imagined I could do anything. But it will take more than\\r\\nimagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I\\u2019m sure I don\\u2019t know\\r\\nhow it can be done.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVII\\r\\nHow the Balloon Was Launched\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for\\r\\nthe little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and\\r\\ncontented. The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his\\r\\nhead; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one could\\r\\nunderstand them but himself. When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt\\r\\nhis heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he had\\r\\ndiscovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he had\\r\\nowned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he was afraid of\\r\\nnothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the\\r\\nfierce Kalidahs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed\\r\\nmore than ever to get back to Kansas.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she\\r\\nentered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this\\r\\ncountry.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd back to Kansas?\\u201d she asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, I\\u2019m not sure about Kansas,\\u201d said Oz, \\u201cfor I haven\\u2019t the faintest\\r\\nnotion which way it lies. But the first thing to do is to cross the\\r\\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow can I cross the desert?\\u201d she inquired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, I\\u2019ll tell you what I think,\\u201d said the little man. \\u201cYou see, when\\r\\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\\r\\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\\r\\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\\r\\npowers to make a cyclone; but I\\u2019ve been thinking the matter over, and I\\r\\nbelieve I can make a balloon.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA balloon,\\u201d said Oz, \\u201cis made of silk, which is coated with glue to\\r\\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\\r\\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\\r\\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf it won\\u2019t float,\\u201d remarked Dorothy, \\u201cit will be of no use to us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTrue,\\u201d answered Oz. \\u201cBut there is another way to make it float, which\\r\\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn\\u2019t as good as gas, for if the\\r\\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\\r\\nshould be lost.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe!\\u201d exclaimed the girl. \\u201cAre you going with me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, of course,\\u201d replied Oz. \\u201cI am tired of being such a humbug. If I\\r\\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\\r\\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\\r\\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\\r\\nI\\u2019d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI shall be glad to have your company,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he answered. \\u201cNow, if you will help me sew the silk\\r\\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips\\r\\nof silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First\\r\\nthere was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and\\r\\nthen a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon\\r\\nin different shades of the color about them. It took three days to sew\\r\\nall the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of\\r\\ngreen silk more than twenty feet long.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\\r\\nairtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut we must have a basket to ride in,\\u201d he said. So he sent the soldier\\r\\nwith the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened\\r\\nwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to\\r\\nmake a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The\\r\\nnews spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the\\r\\nwonderful sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the\\r\\npeople gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a\\r\\nbig pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom\\r\\nof the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it\\r\\nwould be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out\\r\\nand rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\\r\\nground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow\\r\\nwill rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to\\r\\nthe ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much\\r\\nlighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into\\r\\nthe sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome, Dorothy!\\u201d cried the Wizard. \\u201cHurry up, or the balloon will fly\\r\\naway.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t find Toto anywhere,\\u201d replied Dorothy, who did not wish to\\r\\nleave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\\r\\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran\\r\\ntowards the balloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to\\r\\nhelp her into the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon\\r\\nrose into the air without her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome back!\\u201d she screamed. \\u201cI want to go, too!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t come back, my dear,\\u201d called Oz from the basket. \\u201cGood-bye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood-bye!\\u201d shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where\\r\\nthe Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\\r\\nfarther into the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,\\r\\nthough he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we\\r\\nknow. But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this\\r\\nbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise\\r\\nScarecrow to rule over us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful\\r\\nWizard, and would not be comforted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XVIII\\r\\nAway to the South\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas\\r\\nagain; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone\\r\\nup in a balloon. And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her\\r\\ncompanions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman came to her and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTruly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave\\r\\nme my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,\\r\\nif you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWith pleasure,\\u201d she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then the\\r\\nTin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears\\r\\ncarefully and wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he\\r\\nthanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled\\r\\noil-can, to guard against mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he\\r\\nwas not a Wizard the people were proud of him. \\u201cFor,\\u201d they said, \\u201cthere\\r\\nis not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.\\u201d\\r\\nAnd, so far as they knew, they were quite right.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers\\r\\nmet in the Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in\\r\\nthe big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe are not so unlucky,\\u201d said the new ruler, \\u201cfor this Palace and the\\r\\nEmerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I\\r\\nremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer\\u2019s\\r\\ncornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am\\r\\nquite satisfied with my lot.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI also,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \\u201cam well-pleased with my new heart;\\r\\nand, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that\\r\\never lived, if not braver,\\u201d said the Lion modestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,\\u201d\\r\\ncontinued the Scarecrow, \\u201cwe might all be happy together.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t want to live here,\\u201d cried Dorothy. \\u201cI want to go to\\r\\nKansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, then, what can be done?\\u201d inquired the Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins\\r\\nand needles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\\r\\ndesert?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI never thought of that!\\u201d said Dorothy joyfully. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just the thing.\\r\\nI\\u2019ll go at once for the Golden Cap.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\\r\\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\\r\\nstood beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is the second time you have called us,\\u201d said the Monkey King,\\r\\nbowing before the little girl. \\u201cWhat do you wish?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI want you to fly with me to Kansas,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat cannot be done,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe belong to this country alone, and\\r\\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\\r\\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don\\u2019t belong there. We\\r\\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\\r\\nthe desert. Good-bye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\\r\\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. \\u201cI have wasted the charm\\r\\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,\\u201d she said, \\u201cfor the Winged Monkeys\\r\\ncannot help me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is certainly too bad!\\u201d said the tender-hearted Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\\r\\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand ask\\r\\nhis advice.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\\r\\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis little girl,\\u201d said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \\u201cwishes to cross\\r\\nthe desert. How can she do so?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI cannot tell,\\u201d answered the soldier, \\u201cfor nobody has ever crossed the\\r\\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs there no one who can help me?\\u201d asked Dorothy earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGlinda might,\\u201d he suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho is Glinda?\\u201d inquired the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\\r\\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\\r\\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGlinda is a Good Witch, isn\\u2019t she?\\u201d asked the child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Quadlings think she is good,\\u201d said the soldier, \\u201cand she is kind\\r\\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\\r\\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow can I get to her castle?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe road is straight to the South,\\u201d he answered, \\u201cbut it is said to be\\r\\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\\r\\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\\r\\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\\r\\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\\r\\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou must have been thinking again,\\u201d remarked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI shall go with Dorothy,\\u201d declared the Lion, \\u201cfor I am tired of your\\r\\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\\r\\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat is true,\\u201d agreed the Woodman. \\u201cMy axe may be of service to her;\\r\\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhen shall we start?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre you going?\\u201d they asked, in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCertainly. If it wasn\\u2019t for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\\r\\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\r\\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\\r\\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank you,\\u201d said Dorothy gratefully. \\u201cYou are all very kind to me. But\\r\\nI should like to start as soon as possible.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe shall go tomorrow morning,\\u201d returned the Scarecrow. \\u201cSo now let us\\r\\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XIX\\r\\nAttacked by the Fighting Trees\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and\\r\\nthey all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had\\r\\nwalked with them as far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw\\r\\nthem again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City\\r\\nto get into new trouble. But he at once unlocked their spectacles,\\r\\nwhich he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to\\r\\ncarry with them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou are now our ruler,\\u201d he said to the Scarecrow; \\u201cso you must come\\r\\nback to us as soon as possible.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI certainly shall if I am able,\\u201d the Scarecrow replied; \\u201cbut I must\\r\\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has\\r\\nbeen good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t try, my dear,\\u201d he answered. \\u201cWe should like to keep you with us,\\r\\nbut if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a\\r\\nway.\\u201d He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth\\r\\nand started upon their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the\\r\\nLand of the South. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed\\r\\nand chatted together. Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of\\r\\ngetting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of\\r\\nuse to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and\\r\\nwhisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country\\r\\nagain, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,\\r\\nbarking merrily all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCity life does not agree with me at all,\\u201d remarked the Lion, as they\\r\\nwalked along at a brisk pace. \\u201cI have lost much flesh since I lived\\r\\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\\r\\ncourageous I have grown.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they\\r\\ncould see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and\\r\\nhigh up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, as he\\r\\nfelt his heart rattling around in his breast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,\\u201d said the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,\\u201d added the\\r\\nLion, \\u201che would have been a brave man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\\r\\nhad done his best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man,\\r\\neven if he was a bad Wizard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day\\u2019s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers\\r\\nthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that\\r\\nnight on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they\\r\\nrested very well indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There\\r\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\r\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\r\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\\r\\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\\r\\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\\r\\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\\r\\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\\r\\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\\r\\nfellow travelers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\\r\\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere is another space between the trees,\\u201d called the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet me try it first,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cfor it doesn\\u2019t hurt me to\\r\\nget thrown about.\\u201d He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\\r\\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is strange,\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy. \\u201cWhat shall we do?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\r\\njourney,\\u201d remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI believe I will try it myself,\\u201d said the Woodman, and shouldering his\\r\\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\r\\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\\r\\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\\r\\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome on!\\u201d he shouted to the others. \\u201cBe quick!\\u201d They all ran forward\\r\\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\\r\\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\\r\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\\r\\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\\r\\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\\r\\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\\r\\nof it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\\r\\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\\r\\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\\r\\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall we do now?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will make a ladder,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman, \\u201cfor we certainly must\\r\\nclimb over the wall.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XX\\r\\nThe Dainty China Country\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the\\r\\nforest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk.\\r\\nThe Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRest your brains and do not worry about the wall,\\u201d replied the\\r\\nWoodman. \\u201cWhen we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the\\r\\nother side.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin\\r\\nWoodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The\\r\\nScarecrow waked Dorothy and the Lion and Toto, and told them that the\\r\\nladder was ready. The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was\\r\\nso awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from\\r\\nfalling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the\\r\\nScarecrow said, \\u201cOh, my!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo on,\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the\\r\\nwall, and Dorothy put her head over and cried, \\u201cOh, my!\\u201d just as the\\r\\nScarecrow had done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him\\r\\nbe still.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but\\r\\nboth of them cried, \\u201cOh, my!\\u201d as soon as they looked over the wall.\\r\\nWhen they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked\\r\\ndown and saw a strange sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and\\r\\nshining and white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were\\r\\nmany houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.\\r\\nThese houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as\\r\\nhigh as Dorothy\\u2019s waist. There were also pretty little barns, with\\r\\nchina fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs\\r\\nand chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer\\r\\ncountry. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored\\r\\nbodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most\\r\\ngorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in\\r\\nknee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and\\r\\ngolden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon\\r\\ntheir heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns\\r\\nin ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall,\\r\\npointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all made of\\r\\nchina, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\\r\\nthem was no higher than Dorothy\\u2019s knee.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little\\r\\npurple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and\\r\\nbarked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow shall we get down?\\u201d asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the\\r\\nScarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that\\r\\nthe hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not\\r\\nto light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were\\r\\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\\r\\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,\\u201d\\r\\nsaid Dorothy, \\u201cfor it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\\r\\ndue South.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the\\r\\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\\r\\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\\r\\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\\r\\nground with a great clatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\\r\\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\\r\\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere!\\u201d cried the milkmaid angrily. \\u201cSee what you have done! My cow\\r\\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender\\u2019s shop and have\\r\\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\\r\\ncow?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m very sorry,\\u201d returned Dorothy. \\u201cPlease forgive us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\\r\\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\\r\\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\\r\\nglances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\\r\\nelbow close to her side.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must be very careful here,\\u201d said the kind-hearted Woodman, \\u201cor we\\r\\nmay hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young\\r\\nPrincess, who stopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But\\r\\nthe china girl cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t chase me! Don\\u2019t chase me!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\\r\\n\\u201cWhy not?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause,\\u201d answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\\r\\n\\u201cif I run I may fall down and break myself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut could you not be mended?\\u201d asked the girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,\\u201d\\r\\nreplied the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI suppose not,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,\\u201d continued the china lady,\\r\\n\\u201cwho is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\\r\\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn\\u2019t look at all\\r\\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\\r\\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\\r\\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\\r\\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\\r\\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n    \\u201cMy lady fair,\\r\\n   Why do you stare\\r\\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\\r\\n    You\\u2019re quite as stiff\\r\\n    And prim as if\\r\\nYou\\u2019d eaten up a poker!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBe quiet, sir!\\u201d said the Princess. \\u201cCan\\u2019t you see these are strangers,\\r\\nand should be treated with respect?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, that\\u2019s respect, I expect,\\u201d declared the Clown, and immediately\\r\\nstood upon his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t mind Mr. Joker,\\u201d said the Princess to Dorothy. \\u201cHe is\\r\\nconsiderably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t mind him a bit,\\u201d said Dorothy. \\u201cBut you are so beautiful,\\u201d\\r\\nshe continued, \\u201cthat I am sure I could love you dearly. Won\\u2019t you let\\r\\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em\\u2019s mantel? I could\\r\\ncarry you in my basket.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat would make me very unhappy,\\u201d answered the china Princess. \\u201cYou\\r\\nsee, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\\r\\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints\\r\\nat once stiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of\\r\\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\\r\\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\\r\\nhere in our own country.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI would not make you unhappy for all the world!\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy.\\r\\n\\u201cSo I\\u2019ll just say good-bye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood-bye,\\u201d replied the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and\\r\\nall the people scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would\\r\\nbreak them, and after an hour or so the travelers reached the other\\r\\nside of the country and came to another china wall.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the\\r\\nLion\\u2019s back they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion\\r\\ngathered his legs under him and jumped on the wall; but just as he\\r\\njumped, he upset a china church with his tail and smashed it all to\\r\\npieces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat was too bad,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cbut really I think we were lucky in\\r\\nnot doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow\\u2019s leg and a\\r\\nchurch. They are all so brittle!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey are, indeed,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cand I am thankful I am made of\\r\\nstraw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the world\\r\\nthan being a Scarecrow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXI\\r\\nThe Lion Becomes the King of Beasts\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves\\r\\nin a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with\\r\\ntall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy\\r\\nholes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight. However,\\r\\nby carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they\\r\\nreached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and\\r\\nafter a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered\\r\\nanother forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had\\r\\never seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis forest is perfectly delightful,\\u201d declared the Lion, looking\\r\\naround him with joy. \\u201cNever have I seen a more beautiful place.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt seems gloomy,\\u201d said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot a bit of it,\\u201d answered the Lion. \\u201cI should like to live here all\\r\\nmy life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich\\r\\nand green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild\\r\\nbeast could wish a pleasanter home.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,\\u201d said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI suppose there are,\\u201d returned the Lion, \\u201cbut I do not see any of them\\r\\nabout.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any\\r\\nfarther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the\\r\\nWoodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they\\r\\nheard a low rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto\\r\\nwhimpered a little, but none of the others was frightened, and they\\r\\nkept along the well-trodden path until they came to an opening in the\\r\\nwood, in which were gathered hundreds of beasts of every variety. There\\r\\nwere tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the\\r\\nothers in the natural history, and for a moment Dorothy was afraid. But\\r\\nthe Lion explained that the animals were holding a meeting, and he\\r\\njudged by their snarling and growling that they were in great trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the\\r\\ngreat assemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came\\r\\nup to the Lion and bowed, saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWelcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our\\r\\nenemy and bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is your trouble?\\u201d asked the Lion quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe are all threatened,\\u201d answered the tiger, \\u201cby a fierce enemy which\\r\\nhas lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster, like\\r\\na great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a\\r\\ntree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls\\r\\nthrough the forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his\\r\\nmouth, where he eats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe\\r\\nwhile this fierce creature is alive, and we had called a meeting to\\r\\ndecide how to take care of ourselves when you came among us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre there any other lions in this forest?\\u201d he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides,\\r\\nthey were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as\\r\\nKing of the Forest?\\u201d inquired the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe will do that gladly,\\u201d returned the tiger; and all the other beasts\\r\\nroared with a mighty roar: \\u201cWe will!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere is this great spider of yours now?\\u201d asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYonder, among the oak trees,\\u201d said the tiger, pointing with his\\r\\nforefoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake good care of these friends of mine,\\u201d said the Lion, \\u201cand I will\\r\\ngo at once to fight the monster.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle\\r\\nwith the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it\\r\\nlooked so ugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs\\r\\nwere quite as long as the tiger had said, and its body covered with\\r\\ncoarse black hair. It had a great mouth, with a row of sharp teeth a\\r\\nfoot long; but its head was joined to the pudgy body by a neck as\\r\\nslender as a wasp\\u2019s waist. This gave the Lion a hint of the best way to\\r\\nattack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to fight it asleep\\r\\nthan awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the\\r\\nmonster\\u2019s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with\\r\\nsharp claws, he knocked the spider\\u2019s head from its body. Jumping down,\\r\\nhe watched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was\\r\\nquite dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were\\r\\nwaiting for him and said proudly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou need fear your enemy no longer.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised\\r\\nto come back and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her\\r\\nway to Kansas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXII\\r\\nThe Country of the Quadlings\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and\\r\\nwhen they came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered\\r\\nfrom top to bottom with great pieces of rock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat will be a hard climb,\\u201d said the Scarecrow, \\u201cbut we must get over\\r\\nthe hill, nevertheless.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the\\r\\nfirst rock when they heard a rough voice cry out, \\u201cKeep back!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho are you?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, \\u201cThis\\r\\nhill belongs to us, and we don\\u2019t allow anyone to cross it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut we must cross it,\\u201d said the Scarecrow. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to the country\\r\\nof the Quadlings.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut you shall not!\\u201d replied the voice, and there stepped from behind\\r\\nthe rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the\\r\\ntop and supported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms\\r\\nat all, and, seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a\\r\\ncreature could prevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, \\u201cI\\u2019m\\r\\nsorry not to do as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether\\r\\nyou like it or not,\\u201d and he walked boldly forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs quick as lightning the man\\u2019s head shot forward and his neck\\r\\nstretched out until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the\\r\\nScarecrow in the middle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the\\r\\nhill. Almost as quickly as it came the head went back to the body, and\\r\\nthe man laughed harshly as he said, \\u201cIt isn\\u2019t as easy as you think!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy\\r\\nsaw hundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind\\r\\nevery rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow\\u2019s\\r\\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up\\r\\nthe hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the\\r\\nhill as if he had been struck by a cannon ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion\\r\\ncame up to her, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, \\u201cIt is\\r\\nuseless to fight people with shooting heads; no one can withstand\\r\\nthem.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat can we do, then?\\u201d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCall the Winged Monkeys,\\u201d suggested the Tin Woodman. \\u201cYou have still\\r\\nthe right to command them once more.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery well,\\u201d she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she uttered\\r\\nthe magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\\r\\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat are your commands?\\u201d inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing low.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCarry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,\\u201d answered the\\r\\ngirl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt shall be done,\\u201d said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\\r\\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with\\r\\nthem. As they passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with\\r\\nvexation, and shot their heads high in the air, but they could not\\r\\nreach the Winged Monkeys, which carried Dorothy and her comrades safely\\r\\nover the hill and set them down in the beautiful country of the\\r\\nQuadlings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is the last time you can summon us,\\u201d said the leader to Dorothy;\\r\\n\\u201cso good-bye and good luck to you.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood-bye, and thank you very much,\\u201d returned the girl; and the Monkeys\\r\\nrose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field\\r\\nupon field of ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between,\\r\\nand pretty rippling brooks with strong bridges across them. The fences\\r\\nand houses and bridges were all painted bright red, just as they had\\r\\nbeen painted yellow in the country of the Winkies and blue in the\\r\\ncountry of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves, who were short and\\r\\nfat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in red, which\\r\\nshowed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers\\r\\nwalked up to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer\\u2019s\\r\\nwife, and when Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them\\r\\nall a good dinner, with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies,\\r\\nand a bowl of milk for Toto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow far is it to the Castle of Glinda?\\u201d asked the child.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is not a great way,\\u201d answered the farmer\\u2019s wife. \\u201cTake the road to\\r\\nthe South and you will soon reach it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields\\r\\nand across the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very\\r\\nbeautiful Castle. Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in\\r\\nhandsome red uniforms trimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy\\r\\napproached, one of them said to her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy have you come to the South Country?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTo see the Good Witch who rules here,\\u201d she answered. \\u201cWill you take me\\r\\nto her?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive you.\\u201d\\r\\nThey told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.\\r\\nAfter a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others\\r\\nwere to be admitted at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChapter XXIII\\r\\nGlinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy\\u2019s Wish\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of\\r\\nthe Castle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the\\r\\nLion shook the dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself\\r\\ninto his best shape, and the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his\\r\\njoints.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl\\r\\ninto a big room where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red\\r\\nin color and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was\\r\\npure white but her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the\\r\\nlittle girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat can I do for you, my child?\\u201d she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her\\r\\nto the Land of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the\\r\\nwonderful adventures they had met with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy greatest wish now,\\u201d she added, \\u201cis to get back to Kansas, for Aunt\\r\\nEm will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that\\r\\nwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this\\r\\nyear than they were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving\\r\\nlittle girl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBless your dear heart,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI am sure I can tell you of a way\\r\\nto get back to Kansas.\\u201d Then she added, \\u201cBut, if I do, you must give me\\r\\nthe Golden Cap.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWillingly!\\u201d exclaimed Dorothy; \\u201cindeed, it is of no use to me now, and\\r\\nwhen you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three times.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I think I shall need their service just those three times,\\u201d\\r\\nanswered Glinda, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the\\r\\nScarecrow, \\u201cWhat will you do when Dorothy has left us?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will return to the Emerald City,\\u201d he replied, \\u201cfor Oz has made me\\r\\nits ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how\\r\\nto cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBy means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry\\r\\nyou to the gates of the Emerald City,\\u201d said Glinda, \\u201cfor it would be a\\r\\nshame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAm I really wonderful?\\u201d asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou are unusual,\\u201d replied Glinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, \\u201cWhat will become of you when\\r\\nDorothy leaves this country?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, \\u201cThe Winkies\\r\\nwere very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked\\r\\nWitch died. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to\\r\\nthe Country of the West, I should like nothing better than to rule over\\r\\nthem forever.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy second command to the Winged Monkeys,\\u201d said Glinda \\u201cwill be that\\r\\nthey carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be\\r\\nso large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really\\r\\nbrighter than he is\\u2014when you are well polished\\u2014and I am sure you will\\r\\nrule the Winkies wisely and well.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, \\u201cWhen Dorothy\\r\\nhas returned to her own home, what will become of you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOver the hill of the Hammer-Heads,\\u201d he answered, \\u201clies a grand old\\r\\nforest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King. If\\r\\nI could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily\\r\\nthere.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy third command to the Winged Monkeys,\\u201d said Glinda, \\u201cshall be to\\r\\ncarry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden\\r\\nCap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band\\r\\nmay thereafter be free for evermore.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good\\r\\nWitch earnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet\\r\\ntold me how to get back to Kansas.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYour Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,\\u201d replied Glinda. \\u201cIf\\r\\nyou had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em the\\r\\nvery first day you came to this country.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut then I should not have had my wonderful brains!\\u201d cried the\\r\\nScarecrow. \\u201cI might have passed my whole life in the farmer\\u2019s\\r\\ncornfield.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I should not have had my lovely heart,\\u201d said the Tin Woodman. \\u201cI\\r\\nmight have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I should have lived a coward forever,\\u201d declared the Lion, \\u201cand no\\r\\nbeast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis is all true,\\u201d said Dorothy, \\u201cand I am glad I was of use to these\\r\\ngood friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,\\r\\nand each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should\\r\\nlike to go back to Kansas.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Silver Shoes,\\u201d said the Good Witch, \\u201chave wonderful powers. And\\r\\none of the most curious things about them is that they can carry you to\\r\\nany place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in\\r\\nthe wink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together\\r\\nthree times and command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to\\r\\ngo.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf that is so,\\u201d said the child joyfully, \\u201cI will ask them to carry me\\r\\nback to Kansas at once.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nShe threw her arms around the Lion\\u2019s neck and kissed him, patting his\\r\\nbig head tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in\\r\\na way most dangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed\\r\\nbody of the Scarecrow in her arms instead of kissing his painted face,\\r\\nand found she was crying herself at this sorrowful parting from her\\r\\nloving comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little\\r\\ngirl a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she\\r\\nhad shown to her friends and herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last\\r\\ngood-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times,\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake me home to Aunt Em!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she\\r\\ncould see or feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly\\r\\nthat she rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where\\r\\nshe was.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood gracious!\\u201d she cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her\\r\\nwas the new farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried\\r\\naway the old one.

Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.

These apples were always counted, and about\\r\\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\\r\\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\\r\\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\\r\\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o\\u2019clock he fell asleep, and in\\r\\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\\r\\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\\r\\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\\r\\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\\r\\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\\r\\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\\r\\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\\r\\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\\u2019s son\\r\\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\\r\\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\\r\\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\\r\\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\\r\\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, \\u2018One feather is of no\\r\\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gardener\\u2019s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\\r\\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\\r\\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\\r\\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, \\u2018Do not shoot me,\\r\\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\\r\\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\\r\\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\\r\\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\\r\\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\\r\\nto be very poor and mean.\\u2019 But the son thought to himself, \\u2018What can\\r\\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?\\u2019 So he shot his arrow at\\r\\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\\r\\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\\r\\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\\r\\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\\r\\nand poor. \\u2018I should be very silly,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018if I went to that shabby\\r\\nhouse, and left this charming place\\u2019; so he went into the smart house,\\r\\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\\r\\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\\r\\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\\r\\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\\r\\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\\r\\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\\r\\nhis country in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\\r\\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\\r\\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\\r\\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\\r\\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\\r\\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\\r\\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\\r\\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, \\u2018Sit upon my\\r\\ntail, and you will travel faster.\\u2019 So he sat down, and the fox began to\\r\\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\\r\\nwhistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox\\u2019s counsel, and\\r\\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\\r\\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\\r\\nwas beginning his journey, and said, \\u2018Go straight forward, till you come\\r\\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\\r\\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\\r\\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\\r\\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\\r\\nyou will repent it.\\u2019 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\\r\\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\\r\\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\\r\\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\\r\\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\\r\\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, \\u2018It will be a\\r\\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage\\u2019; so\\r\\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\\r\\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\\r\\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\\r\\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\\r\\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\\r\\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\\r\\ngiven him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\\r\\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \\u2018You see now\\r\\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\\r\\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\\r\\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\\r\\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\\r\\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\\r\\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\\u2019\\r\\nThen the son sat down on the fox\\u2019s tail, and away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\\r\\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\\r\\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. \\u2018I will give him the good one,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid he; \\u2018I am sure he deserves it.\\u2019 As he took up the golden saddle the\\r\\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\\r\\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\\r\\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\\r\\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\\r\\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, \\u2018Why\\r\\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\\r\\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\\r\\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\\r\\no\\u2019clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\\r\\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\\r\\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.\\u2019\\r\\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\\r\\no\\u2019clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\\r\\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\\r\\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\\r\\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\\r\\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her father\\u2019s house the guards\\r\\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, \\u2018You shall never\\r\\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\\r\\nthe view from my window.\\u2019 Now this hill was so big that the whole world\\r\\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\\r\\ndone very little, the fox came and said. \\u2018Lie down and go to sleep; I\\r\\nwill work for you.\\u2019 And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\\r\\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\\r\\nremoved he must give him the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\\r\\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, \\u2018We will have all\\r\\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the young man,\\r\\n\\u2018that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018If you will only listen,\\u2019 said the fox, \\u2018it can be done. When you come\\r\\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, \\u201cHere\\r\\nshe is!\\u201d Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\\r\\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\\r\\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\\r\\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\\r\\nfast as you can.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right: then the fox said, \\u2018When you come to the castle where\\r\\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\\r\\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\\r\\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\\r\\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\\r\\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\\r\\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\\r\\ncame, and said, \\u2018Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.\\u2019 But the\\r\\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, \\u2018I will at any rate give\\r\\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\\r\\nand sit down by the side of no river.\\u2019 Then away he went. \\u2018Well,\\u2019\\r\\nthought the young man, \\u2018it is no hard matter to keep that advice.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\\r\\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\\r\\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, \\u2018Two men\\r\\nare going to be hanged.\\u2019 As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\\r\\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, \\u2018Cannot they in any\\r\\nway be saved?\\u2019 But the people said \\u2018No,\\u2019 unless he would bestow all his\\r\\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\\r\\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\\r\\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\\r\\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, \\u2018Let us sit down by the\\r\\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.\\u2019 So he said,\\r\\n\\u2018Yes,\\u2019 and forgot the fox\\u2019s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\\r\\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\\r\\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\\r\\nhome to the king their master, and said. \\u2018All this have we won by our\\r\\nlabour.\\u2019 Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\\r\\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river\\u2019s bed: luckily it was\\r\\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\\r\\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\\r\\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\\r\\nhave befallen him: \\u2018Yet,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\\r\\nof my tail and hold fast.\\u2019 Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\\r\\nto him, as he got upon the bank, \\u2018Your brothers have set watch to kill\\r\\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.\\u2019 So he dressed himself as a poor\\r\\nman, and came secretly to the king\\u2019s court, and was scarcely within the\\r\\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\\r\\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\\r\\nbrothers\\u2019 roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\\r\\nprincess given to him again; and after the king\\u2019s death he was heir to\\r\\nhis kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\\r\\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\\r\\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\\r\\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\\r\\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANS IN LUCK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\\r\\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\\r\\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\\r\\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\\r\\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\\r\\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\\r\\nknow about the matter?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\\r\\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, \\u2018Master, my time is up; I\\r\\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\\r\\nand let me go.\\u2019 And the master said, \\u2018You have been a faithful and good\\r\\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.\\u2019 Then he gave him a lump\\r\\nof silver as big as his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\\r\\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\\r\\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\\r\\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said Hans aloud, \\u2018what a\\r\\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\\r\\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\\r\\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.\\u2019 Hans did\\r\\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, \\u2018Well,\\r\\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I have this load to\\r\\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can\\u2019t hold up\\r\\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you say\\r\\nof making an exchange?\\u2019 said the horseman. \\u2018I will give you my horse,\\r\\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\\r\\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.\\u2019 \\u2018With all my\\r\\nheart,\\u2019 said Hans: \\u2018but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\\r\\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.\\u2019\\r\\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\\r\\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, \\u2018When\\r\\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\\r\\n\\u201cJip!\\u201d\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\\r\\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\\r\\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018No care and no sorrow,\\r\\n  A fig for the morrow!\\r\\n  We\\u2019ll laugh and be merry,\\r\\n  Sing neigh down derry!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\\r\\nsmacked his lips and cried \\u2018Jip!\\u2019 Away went the horse full gallop; and\\r\\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\\r\\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\\r\\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\\r\\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\\r\\nshepherd, \\u2018This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\\r\\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\\r\\nhis neck. However, I\\u2019m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\\r\\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\\r\\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\\r\\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one\\u2019s leisure behind that\\r\\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\\r\\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe shepherd, \\u2018if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\\r\\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\\r\\nmyself.\\u2019 \\u2018Done!\\u2019 said Hans, merrily. \\u2018What a noble heart that good man\\r\\nhas!\\u2019 thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\\r\\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\\r\\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\\r\\none. \\u2018If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\\r\\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\\r\\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\\r\\ncan I wish for more?\\u2019 When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\\r\\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\\r\\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother\\u2019s\\r\\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\\r\\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\\r\\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\\r\\nclave to the roof of his mouth. \\u2018I can find a cure for this,\\u2019 thought\\r\\nhe; \\u2018now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst\\u2019: so he tied her to the\\r\\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\\r\\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\\r\\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\\r\\nnot thought of looking to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\\r\\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\\r\\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\\r\\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\\r\\npig in a wheelbarrow. \\u2018What is the matter with you, my man?\\u2019 said the\\r\\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\\r\\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\\r\\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, \\u2018There, drink and refresh\\r\\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don\\u2019t you see she is an old\\r\\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?\\u2019 \\u2018Alas, alas!\\u2019 said\\r\\nHans, \\u2018who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\\r\\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\\r\\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\\r\\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\\r\\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe butcher, \\u2018I don\\u2019t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\\r\\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\\r\\npig for the cow.\\u2019 \\u2018Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\\r\\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\\r\\nits leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\\r\\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\\r\\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\\r\\nlast got?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\\r\\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o\\u2019clock; this led to further chat;\\r\\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\\r\\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\\r\\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\\r\\nchristening. \\u2018Feel,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\\r\\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\\r\\nit has lived so well!\\u2019 \\u2018You\\u2019re right,\\u2019 said Hans, as he weighed it in\\r\\nhis hand; \\u2018but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.\\u2019 Meantime the\\r\\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. \\u2018Hark ye!\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can\\u2019t help doing\\r\\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\\r\\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\\r\\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire\\u2019s pig. If\\r\\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\\r\\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. \\u2018Good man,\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018pray get me out\\r\\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\\r\\nbut he may have been the squire\\u2019s for aught I can tell: you know this\\r\\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.\\u2019 \\u2018I ought\\r\\nto have something into the bargain,\\u2019 said the countryman; \\u2018give a fat\\r\\ngoose for a pig, indeed! \\u2018Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\\r\\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\\r\\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. \\u2018After all,\\u2019\\r\\nthought he, \\u2018that chap is pretty well taken in. I don\\u2019t care whose pig\\r\\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\\r\\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\\r\\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\\r\\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\\r\\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\\r\\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\\r\\nworking and singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O\\u2019er hill and o\\u2019er dale\\r\\n  So happy I roam,\\r\\n  Work light and live well,\\r\\n  All the world is my home;\\r\\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, \\u2018You must be well\\r\\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nother, \\u2018mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\\r\\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\\r\\nbeautiful goose?\\u2019 \\u2018I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.\\u2019 \\u2018And where\\r\\ndid you get the pig?\\u2019 \\u2018I gave a cow for it.\\u2019 \\u2018And the cow?\\u2019 \\u2018I gave a\\r\\nhorse for it.\\u2019 \\u2018And the horse?\\u2019 \\u2018I gave a lump of silver as big as my\\r\\nhead for it.\\u2019 \\u2018And the silver?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\\r\\nyears.\\u2019 \\u2018You have thriven well in the world hitherto,\\u2019 said the grinder,\\r\\n\\u2018now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\\r\\nin it, your fortune would be made.\\u2019 \\u2018Very true: but how is that to be\\r\\nmanaged?\\u2019 \\u2018How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,\\u2019 said the other;\\r\\n\\u2018you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\\r\\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\\r\\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?\\u2019 \\u2018How can you ask?\\u2019 said\\r\\nHans; \\u2018I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\\r\\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there\\u2019s\\r\\nthe goose.\\u2019 \\u2018Now,\\u2019 said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\\r\\nthat lay by his side, \\u2018this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\\r\\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\\r\\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, \\u2018Surely I must have been born\\r\\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\\r\\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\\r\\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\\r\\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\\r\\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\\r\\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\\r\\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\\r\\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\\r\\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\\r\\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\\r\\nthe ugly heavy stone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018How happy am I!\\u2019 cried he; \\u2018nobody was ever so lucky as I.\\u2019 Then up he\\r\\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\\r\\nhe reached his mother\\u2019s house, and told her how very easy the road to\\r\\ngood luck was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\\r\\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\\r\\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\\r\\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\\r\\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\\r\\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\\r\\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\\r\\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\\r\\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\\r\\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\\r\\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\\r\\nbeautiful birds in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\\r\\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\\r\\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\\r\\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\\r\\nalone; and Jorindel said, \\u2018We must take care that we don\\u2019t go too near\\r\\nto the fairy\\u2019s castle.\\u2019 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\\r\\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\\r\\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\\r\\nbirches.\\r\\n\\r\\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\\r\\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\\r\\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\\r\\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\\r\\nat a loss to know what path to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\\r\\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\\r\\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\\r\\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\\r\\nJorinda was just singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\\r\\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\\r\\n  He mourn\\u2019d for the fate of his darling mate,\\r\\n  Well-a-day!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\\r\\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\\r\\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\\r\\nround them, and three times screamed:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\\r\\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\\r\\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\\r\\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\\r\\nchin that almost met one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\\r\\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\\r\\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\\r\\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Till the prisoner is fast,\\r\\n  And her doom is cast,\\r\\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\\r\\n  When the charm is around her,\\r\\n  And the spell has bound her,\\r\\n  Hie away! away!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\\r\\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\\r\\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\\r\\nwent her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 he said, \\u2018what\\r\\nwill become of me?\\u2019 He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\\r\\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\\r\\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\\r\\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\\r\\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\\r\\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\\r\\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\\r\\nfound his Jorinda again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\\r\\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\\r\\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\\r\\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\\r\\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\\r\\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\\r\\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\\r\\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\\r\\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\\r\\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\\r\\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\\r\\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\\r\\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\\r\\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\\r\\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\\r\\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\\r\\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\\r\\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\\r\\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\\r\\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\\r\\nthey walked together in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\\r\\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\\r\\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\\r\\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy\\u2019s\\r\\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\\r\\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\\r\\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\\r\\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\\r\\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\\r\\ntowards the great city, \\u2018For there,\\u2019 thought he, \\u2018I may turn musician.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\\r\\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. \\u2018What makes you pant so, my\\r\\nfriend?\\u2019 said the ass. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said the dog, \\u2018my master was going to\\r\\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\\r\\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\\r\\nearn my livelihood?\\u2019 \\u2018Hark ye!\\u2019 said the ass, \\u2018I am going to the great\\r\\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\\r\\ndo in the same way?\\u2019 The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\\r\\nroad and making a most rueful face. \\u2018Pray, my good lady,\\u2019 said the ass,\\r\\n\\u2018what\\u2019s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, me!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the cat, \\u2018how can one be in good spirits when one\\u2019s life is in\\r\\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\\r\\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\\r\\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Oh,\\u2019 said the ass, \\u2018by all means go with us to the great city; you are\\r\\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.\\u2019 The cat\\r\\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\\r\\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\\r\\n\\u2018Bravo!\\u2019 said the ass; \\u2018upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\\r\\nis all this about?\\u2019 \\u2018Why,\\u2019 said the cock, \\u2018I was just now saying that\\r\\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\\r\\nthe cook don\\u2019t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\\r\\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\\r\\non Sunday!\\u2019 \\u2018Heaven forbid!\\u2019 said the ass, \\u2018come with us Master\\r\\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\\r\\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\\r\\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.\\u2019 \\u2018With all my\\r\\nheart,\\u2019 said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\\r\\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\\r\\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\\r\\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\\r\\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\\r\\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\\r\\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\\r\\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, \\u2018There must be a\\r\\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.\\u2019 \\u2018If that be the case,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe ass, \\u2018we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\\r\\nbest in the world!\\u2019 \\u2018Besides,\\u2019 added the dog, \\u2018I should not be the\\r\\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.\\u2019 So they walked off together\\r\\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\\r\\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\\r\\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\\r\\npeeped in. \\u2018Well, Donkey,\\u2019 said Chanticleer, \\u2018what do you see?\\u2019 \\u2018What\\r\\ndo I see?\\u2019 replied the ass. \\u2018Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\\r\\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.\\u2019 \\u2018That would\\r\\nbe a noble lodging for us,\\u2019 said the cock. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the ass, \\u2018if we\\r\\ncould only get in\\u2019; so they consulted together how they should contrive\\r\\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\\r\\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\\r\\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog\\u2019s\\r\\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat\\u2019s head. When\\r\\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\\r\\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\\r\\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\\r\\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\\r\\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\\r\\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\\r\\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\\r\\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\\r\\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\\r\\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\\r\\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\\r\\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\\r\\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\\r\\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\\r\\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\\r\\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\\r\\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\\r\\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\\r\\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\\r\\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\\r\\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\\r\\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\\r\\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\\r\\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\\r\\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\\r\\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\\r\\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\\r\\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\\r\\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\\r\\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\\r\\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\\r\\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\\r\\n\\u2018Throw the rascal up here!\\u2019 After this the robbers never dared to go\\r\\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\\r\\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\\r\\nthis very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD SULTAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\\r\\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\\r\\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, \\u2018I will shoot\\r\\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.\\u2019 But his wife\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\\r\\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\\r\\nhis days.\\u2019 \\u2018But what can we do with him?\\u2019 said the shepherd, \\u2018he has not\\r\\na tooth in his head, and the thieves don\\u2019t care for him at all; to\\r\\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\\r\\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\\r\\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\\r\\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\\r\\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\\r\\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. \\u2018Make yourself\\r\\neasy,\\u2019 said the wolf, \\u2018I will give you some good advice. Your master,\\r\\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\\r\\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\\r\\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\\r\\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\\r\\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\\r\\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\\r\\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\\r\\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.\\u2019 The dog liked this\\r\\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\\r\\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\\r\\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\\r\\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, \\u2018Old\\r\\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\\r\\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\\r\\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\\r\\nas long as he lives.\\u2019 So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\\r\\ncould wish for.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, \\u2018Now, my\\r\\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\\r\\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd\\u2019s fine fat sheep.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the Sultan; \\u2018I will be true to my master.\\u2019 However, the wolf\\r\\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\\r\\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\\r\\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\\r\\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\\r\\nhis locks for him finely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan \\u2018an old rogue,\\u2019 and\\r\\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\\r\\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\\r\\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd\\u2019s old\\r\\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\\r\\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\\r\\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat\\u2019s long tail standing\\r\\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\\r\\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\\r\\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\\r\\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\\r\\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\\r\\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\\r\\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\\r\\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\\r\\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\\r\\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, \\u2018Look up in the tree, there\\r\\nsits the one who is to blame.\\u2019 So they looked up, and espied the wolf\\r\\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\\r\\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\\r\\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\\r\\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\\r\\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\\r\\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\\r\\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\\r\\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\\r\\nbegan and said: \\u2018Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\\u2019 The coal\\r\\nreplied: \\u2018I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\\r\\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\\r\\nburnt to ashes.\\u2019 The bean said: \\u2018I too have escaped with a whole skin,\\r\\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\\r\\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.\\u2019 \\u2018And would a better\\r\\nfate have fallen to my lot?\\u2019 said the straw. \\u2018The old woman has\\r\\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\\r\\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018But what are we to do now?\\u2019 said the coal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I think,\\u2019 answered the bean, \\u2018that as we have so fortunately escaped\\r\\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\\r\\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\\r\\nrepair to a foreign country.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\\r\\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\\r\\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\\r\\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: \\u2018I will lay myself straight\\r\\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\\u2019 The straw\\r\\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\\r\\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\\r\\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\\r\\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\\r\\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\\r\\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\\r\\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\\r\\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\\r\\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\\r\\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\\r\\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\\r\\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\\r\\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\\r\\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIAR ROSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\\r\\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\\r\\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\\r\\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\\r\\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\\r\\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\\r\\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\\r\\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\\r\\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\\r\\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\\r\\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, \\u2018I know what your wish is,\\r\\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\\r\\nsoon have a daughter.\\u2019 What the little fish had foretold soon came to\\r\\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\\r\\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\\r\\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\\r\\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\\r\\nto our little daughter.\\u2019 Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\\r\\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\\r\\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\\r\\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\\r\\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\\r\\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\\r\\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\\r\\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\\r\\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\\r\\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\\r\\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\\r\\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\\r\\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\\r\\nrevenge. So she cried out, \\u2018The king\\u2019s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\\r\\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\\u2019 Then the twelfth of\\r\\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\\r\\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\\r\\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king\\u2019s daughter, when the spindle\\r\\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\\r\\nhundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\\r\\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\\r\\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\\r\\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\\r\\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\\r\\nher loved her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\\r\\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\\r\\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\\r\\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\\r\\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\\r\\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\\r\\naway very busily. \\u2018Why, how now, good mother,\\u2019 said the princess; \\u2018what\\r\\nare you doing there?\\u2019 \\u2018Spinning,\\u2019 said the old lady, and nodded her\\r\\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. \\u2018How prettily that\\r\\nlittle thing turns round!\\u2019 said the princess, and took the spindle\\r\\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\\r\\nfairy\\u2019s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\\r\\ndown lifeless on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\\r\\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\\r\\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\\r\\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\\r\\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\\r\\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\\r\\ngoose upon it for the king\\u2019s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\\r\\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\\r\\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\\r\\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\\r\\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\\r\\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\\r\\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\\r\\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\\r\\nRose (for so the king\\u2019s daughter was called): so that, from time to\\r\\ntime, several kings\\u2019 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\\r\\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\\r\\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\\r\\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many, many years there came a king\\u2019s son into that land: and an\\r\\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\\r\\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\\r\\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\\r\\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\\r\\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\\r\\ndied. Then the young prince said, \\u2018All this shall not frighten me; I\\r\\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.\\u2019 The old man tried to hinder him, but\\r\\nhe was bent upon going.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\\r\\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\\r\\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\\r\\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\\r\\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\\r\\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\\r\\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\\r\\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\\r\\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\\r\\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\\r\\nif she was going to beat the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\\r\\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\\r\\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\\r\\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\\r\\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\\r\\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\\r\\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\\r\\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\\r\\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\\r\\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\\r\\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\\r\\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\\r\\nwith the goose for the king\\u2019s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\\r\\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\\r\\nthe boy the box on his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\\r\\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherd\\u2019s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\\r\\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\\r\\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\\r\\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \\u2018Why are you so sad,\\r\\nmy friend?\\u2019 \\u2018Because,\\u2019 said the dog, \\u2018I am very very hungry, and have\\r\\nnothing to eat.\\u2019 \\u2018If that be all,\\u2019 answered the sparrow, \\u2018come with me\\r\\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\\u2019 So on they\\r\\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\\u2019s shop,\\r\\nthe sparrow said to the dog, \\u2018Stand there a little while till I peck you\\r\\ndown a piece of meat.\\u2019 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\\r\\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\\r\\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\\r\\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\\r\\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe sparrow, \\u2018you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\\r\\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\\u2019 When the dog had\\r\\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \\u2018Well, my good friend, have you\\r\\nhad enough now?\\u2019 \\u2018I have had plenty of meat,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018but I should\\r\\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\\u2019 \\u2018Come with me then,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the sparrow, \\u2018and you shall soon have that too.\\u2019 So she took him\\r\\nto a baker\\u2019s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\\r\\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\\r\\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\\r\\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said he; \\u2018and\\r\\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\\u2019 So they both went\\r\\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\\r\\nfar before the dog said, \\u2018I am very much tired--I should like to take a\\r\\nnap.\\u2019 \\u2018Very well,\\u2019 answered the sparrow, \\u2018do so, and in the meantime\\r\\nI will perch upon that bush.\\u2019 So the dog stretched himself out on the\\r\\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\\r\\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\\r\\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\\r\\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\\r\\nout, \\u2018Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\\u2019 But the\\r\\ncarter, grumbling to himself, \\u2018You make it the worse for me, indeed!\\r\\nwhat can you do?\\u2019 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\\r\\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \\u2018There,\\u2019 cried the\\r\\nsparrow, \\u2018thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\\r\\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Do your worst, and welcome,\\u2019 said the brute, \\u2018what harm can you do me?\\u2019\\r\\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\\r\\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\\r\\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\\r\\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\\r\\n\\u2018What an unlucky wretch I am!\\u2019 cried he. \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\\r\\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\\r\\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\\r\\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\\u2019s head\\r\\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. \\u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\\u2019\\r\\ncried he. \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 said the sparrow. And as the carter\\r\\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\\r\\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\\r\\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \\u2018Miserable wretch\\r\\nthat I am!\\u2019 But the sparrow answered, \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 and\\r\\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\\r\\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\\r\\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\\r\\nspot. \\u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\\u2019 said he. \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\\r\\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\\r\\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\\r\\nthird horse as he done the other two. \\u2018Alas! miserable wretch that I\\r\\nam!\\u2019 cried he. \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 answered the sparrow as she flew\\r\\naway; \\u2018now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\\u2019 The\\r\\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\\r\\noverflowing with rage and vexation. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said he to his wife, \\u2018what\\r\\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\\r\\ndead.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas! husband,\\u2019 replied she, \\u2018and a wicked bird has come into\\r\\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\\r\\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\\r\\nup at such a rate!\\u2019 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\\r\\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\\r\\nmidst of them. \\u2018Unlucky wretch that I am!\\u2019 cried the carter; for he saw\\r\\nthat the corn was almost all gone. \\u2018Not wretch enough yet!\\u2019 said the\\r\\nsparrow; \\u2018thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!\\u2019 and away she flew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\\r\\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\\r\\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\\r\\non the outside of the window, and cried \\u2018Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\\r\\nthee thy life!\\u2019 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\\r\\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\\r\\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\\r\\ncried, \\u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\\u2019 Then he became mad and\\r\\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\\r\\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\\r\\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\\r\\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\\r\\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\\r\\nwife said, \\u2018Shall I kill her at once?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018that is letting\\r\\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\\r\\nher.\\u2019 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\\r\\nand cried, \\u2018Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\\u2019 With that he\\r\\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \\u2018Wife,\\r\\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\\u2019 And the wife struck; but\\r\\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\\r\\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\\r\\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\\r\\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\\r\\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\\r\\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\\r\\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\\r\\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\\r\\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\\r\\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nA king\\u2019s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\\r\\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\\r\\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\\r\\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\\r\\nof his chamber was left open. But the king\\u2019s son soon fell asleep; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\\r\\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\\r\\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\\r\\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\\r\\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\\r\\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\\r\\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\\r\\nwho asked him where he was going. \\u2018I hardly know where I am going, or\\r\\nwhat I had better do,\\u2019 said the soldier; \\u2018but I think I should like very\\r\\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\\r\\nI might be a king.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the old dame, \\u2018that is no very hard\\r\\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\\r\\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\\r\\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, \\u2018As soon as you put that on\\r\\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\\r\\nprincesses wherever they go.\\u2019 When the soldier heard all this good\\r\\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\\r\\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\\r\\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\\r\\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\\r\\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\\r\\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\\r\\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\\r\\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\\r\\nheartily; and the eldest said, \\u2018This fellow too might have done a wiser\\r\\nthing than lose his life in this way!\\u2019 Then they rose up and opened\\r\\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\\r\\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\\r\\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, \\u2018I don\\u2019t know how it is, while\\r\\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\\r\\nbefall us.\\u2019 \\u2018You simpleton,\\u2019 said the eldest, \\u2018you are always afraid;\\r\\nhave you forgotten how many kings\\u2019 sons have already watched in vain?\\r\\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\\r\\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\\r\\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\\r\\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\\r\\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\\r\\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\\r\\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\\r\\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\\r\\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\\r\\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, \\u2018All is not right; someone\\r\\ntook hold of my gown.\\u2019 \\u2018You silly creature!\\u2019 said the eldest, \\u2018it is\\r\\nnothing but a nail in the wall.\\u2019 Then down they all went, and at the\\r\\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\\r\\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\\r\\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\\r\\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\\r\\nyoungest daughter said again, \\u2018I am sure all is not right--did not you\\r\\nhear that noise? That never happened before.\\u2019 But the eldest said, \\u2018It\\r\\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\\r\\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\\r\\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\\r\\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\\r\\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\\r\\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\\r\\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\\r\\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\\r\\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\\r\\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\\r\\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\\r\\nseems very heavy today.\\u2019 \\u2018It is only the heat of the weather,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nprincess: \\u2018I feel it very warm too.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\\r\\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\\r\\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\\r\\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\\r\\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\\r\\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\\r\\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\\r\\nsilenced her. They danced on till three o\\u2019clock in the morning, and then\\r\\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\\r\\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\\r\\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\\r\\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\\r\\nto come again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\\r\\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\\r\\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, \\u2018Now all\\r\\nis quite safe\\u2019; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\\r\\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\\r\\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\\r\\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\\r\\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\\r\\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\\r\\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\\r\\ntoken of where he had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\\r\\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\\r\\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\\r\\nsay. And when the king asked him. \\u2018Where do my twelve daughters dance at\\r\\nnight?\\u2019 he answered, \\u2018With twelve princes in a castle under ground.\\u2019 And\\r\\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\\r\\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\\r\\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\\r\\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\\r\\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\\r\\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\\r\\nanswered, \\u2018I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.\\u2019--And they\\r\\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king\\u2019s\\r\\nheir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\\r\\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\\r\\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\\r\\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\\r\\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\\r\\nBut the fish said, \\u2018Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\\r\\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, ho!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the man, \\u2018you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\\r\\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\\r\\nas you please!\\u2019 Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\\r\\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\\r\\non the wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\\r\\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\\r\\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. \\u2018Did not\\r\\nyou ask it for anything?\\u2019 said the wife, \\u2018we live very wretchedly here,\\r\\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\\r\\nlittle cottage.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\\r\\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\\r\\ngreen. And he stood at the water\\u2019s edge, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, \\u2018Well, what is her will?\\r\\nWhat does your wife want?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the fisherman, \\u2018she says that when\\r\\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\\r\\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\\r\\na snug little cottage.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home, then,\\u2019 said the fish; \\u2018she is in the\\r\\ncottage already!\\u2019 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\\r\\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. \\u2018Come in, come in!\\u2019 said she; \\u2018is\\r\\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?\\u2019 And there was a\\r\\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\\r\\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\\r\\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the\\r\\nfisherman, \\u2018how happily we shall live now!\\u2019 \\u2018We will try to do so, at\\r\\nleast,\\u2019 said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\\r\\n\\u2018Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\\r\\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\\r\\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\\r\\nto give us a castle.\\u2019 \\u2018Wife,\\u2019 said the fisherman, \\u2018I don\\u2019t like to go to\\r\\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\\r\\npretty cottage to live in.\\u2019 \\u2018Nonsense!\\u2019 said the wife; \\u2018he will do it\\r\\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\\r\\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\\r\\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well, what does she want now?\\u2019 said the fish. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the man,\\r\\ndolefully, \\u2018my wife wants to live in a stone castle.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home, then,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the fish; \\u2018she is standing at the gate of it already.\\u2019 So away went\\r\\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\\r\\ncastle. \\u2018See,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018is not this grand?\\u2019 With that they went into\\r\\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\\r\\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\\r\\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\\r\\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\\r\\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018now we\\r\\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\\r\\nour lives.\\u2019 \\u2018Perhaps we may,\\u2019 said the wife; \\u2018but let us sleep upon it,\\r\\nbefore we make up our minds to that.\\u2019 So they went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\\r\\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \\u2018Get up, husband,\\r\\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\\u2019 \\u2018Wife, wife,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the man, \\u2018why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Then I will,\\u2019 said she. \\u2018But, wife,\\u2019 said the fisherman, \\u2018how can you\\r\\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?\\u2019 \\u2018Husband,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018say\\r\\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.\\u2019 So the man went away\\r\\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\\r\\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\\r\\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well, what would she have now?\\u2019 said the fish. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said the poor\\r\\nman, \\u2018my wife wants to be king.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home,\\u2019 said the fish; \\u2018she is king\\r\\nalready.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\\r\\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\\r\\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\\r\\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\\r\\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. \\u2018Well, wife,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nfisherman, \\u2018are you king?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I am king.\\u2019 And when he had\\r\\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, \\u2018Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\\r\\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\\r\\nas we live.\\u2019 \\u2018I don\\u2019t know how that may be,\\u2019 said she; \\u2018never is a long\\r\\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\\r\\nthink I should like to be emperor.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas, wife! why should you wish to\\r\\nbe emperor?\\u2019 said the fisherman. \\u2018Husband,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018go to the fish!\\r\\nI say I will be emperor.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, wife!\\u2019 replied the fisherman, \\u2018the fish\\r\\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\\r\\nsuch a thing.\\u2019 \\u2018I am king,\\u2019 said Ilsabill, \\u2018and you are my slave; so go\\r\\nat once!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\\r\\n\\u2018This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\\r\\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\\u2019 He\\r\\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\\r\\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\\r\\nwent as near as he could to the water\\u2019s brink, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What would she have now?\\u2019 said the fish. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the fisherman,\\r\\n\\u2018she wants to be emperor.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home,\\u2019 said the fish; \\u2018she is emperor\\r\\nalready.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\\r\\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\\r\\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\\r\\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\\r\\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\\r\\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\\r\\nup to her and said, \\u2018Wife, are you emperor?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I am\\r\\nemperor.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the man, as he gazed upon her, \\u2018what a fine thing\\r\\nit is to be emperor!\\u2019 \\u2018Husband,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018why should we stop at being\\r\\nemperor? I will be pope next.\\u2019 \\u2018O wife, wife!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018how can you be\\r\\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.\\u2019 \\u2018Husband,\\u2019 said\\r\\nshe, \\u2018I will be pope this very day.\\u2019 \\u2018But,\\u2019 replied the husband, \\u2018the\\r\\nfish cannot make you pope.\\u2019 \\u2018What nonsense!\\u2019 said she; \\u2018if he can make\\r\\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\\r\\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\\r\\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\\r\\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\\r\\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\\r\\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\\r\\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What does she want now?\\u2019 said the fish. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the fisherman, \\u2018my\\r\\nwife wants to be pope.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home,\\u2019 said the fish; \\u2018she is pope already.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\\r\\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\\r\\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\\r\\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\\r\\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\\r\\nlarger than a small rushlight. \\u2018Wife,\\u2019 said the fisherman, as he looked\\r\\nat all this greatness, \\u2018are you pope?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I am pope.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Well, wife,\\u2019 replied he, \\u2018it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\\r\\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.\\u2019 \\u2018I will think about\\r\\nthat,\\u2019 said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\\r\\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\\r\\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. \\u2018Ha!\\u2019 thought she,\\r\\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, \\u2018after all I cannot\\r\\nprevent the sun rising.\\u2019 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\\r\\nher husband, and said, \\u2018Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\\u2019 The fisherman was half asleep, but the\\r\\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\\r\\n\\u2018Alas, wife!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018cannot you be easy with being pope?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid she, \\u2018I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\\r\\nleave. Go to the fish at once!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\\r\\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\\r\\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\\r\\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\\r\\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\\r\\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\\r\\nand cried out, as well as he could:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What does she want now?\\u2019 said the fish. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018she wants to\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\\u2019 \\u2018Go home,\\u2019 said the fish, \\u2018to your pigsty\\r\\nagain.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there they live to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\\r\\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: \\u2018Brother\\r\\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?\\u2019 \\u2018That is the King of birds,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the wolf, \\u2018before whom we must bow down.\\u2019 In reality the bird was\\r\\nthe willow-wren. \\u2018IF that\\u2019s the case,\\u2019 said the bear, \\u2018I should very\\r\\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\\u2019 \\u2018That is not\\r\\ndone quite as you seem to think,\\u2019 said the wolf; \\u2018you must wait until\\r\\nthe Queen comes,\\u2019 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\\r\\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\\r\\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\\r\\nback by the sleeve, and said: \\u2018No, you must wait until the lord and lady\\r\\nQueen have gone away again.\\u2019 So they took stock of the hole where the\\r\\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\\r\\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\\r\\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\\r\\nfive or six young ones lying there. \\u2018Is that the royal palace?\\u2019 cried\\r\\nthe bear; \\u2018it is a wretched palace, and you are not King\\u2019s children, you\\r\\nare disreputable children!\\u2019 When the young wrens heard that, they were\\r\\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: \\u2018No, that we are not! Our parents are\\r\\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\\r\\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\\r\\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: \\u2018We will not so much as\\r\\ntouch one fly\\u2019s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\\r\\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\\r\\nhere and has insulted us!\\u2019 Then the old King said: \\u2018Be easy, he shall\\r\\nbe punished,\\u2019 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\\u2019s cave, and\\r\\ncalled in: \\u2018Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\\r\\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.\\u2019 Thus war was\\r\\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\\r\\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\\r\\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\\r\\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\\r\\nflies had to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\\r\\nto discover who was the enemy\\u2019s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\\r\\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\\r\\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\\r\\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\\r\\ngeneral and lead us.\\u2019 \\u2018Good,\\u2019 said the fox, \\u2018but what signal shall we\\r\\nagree upon?\\u2019 No one knew that, so the fox said: \\u2018I have a fine long\\r\\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\\r\\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\\r\\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.\\u2019 When the gnat had heard\\r\\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\\r\\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\\r\\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\\r\\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\\r\\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\\r\\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\\r\\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\\r\\nbeneath the fox\\u2019s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\\r\\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\\r\\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\\r\\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\\r\\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\\r\\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\\r\\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\\r\\n\\u2018Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\\u2019s content, we have won\\r\\nthe battle!\\u2019 But the young wrens said: \\u2018We will not eat yet, the bear\\r\\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\\r\\nchildren, before we will do that.\\u2019 Then the willow-wren flew to the\\r\\nbear\\u2019s hole and cried: \\u2018Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\\r\\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\\r\\nbe broken.\\u2019 So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\\r\\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\\r\\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\\r\\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\\r\\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\\r\\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\\r\\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\\r\\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\\r\\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\\r\\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\\r\\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\\r\\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\\r\\nher loss, and said, \\u2018Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\\r\\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\\r\\nworld.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\\r\\n\\u2018Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\\u2019 \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said she, \\u2018what can you\\r\\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\\u2019\\r\\nThe frog said, \\u2018I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\\r\\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\\r\\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\\r\\nagain.\\u2019 \\u2018What nonsense,\\u2019 thought the princess, \\u2018this silly frog is\\r\\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\\r\\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\\r\\nshall have what he asks.\\u2019 So she said to the frog, \\u2018Well, if you will\\r\\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.\\u2019 Then the frog put his head\\r\\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\\r\\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\\r\\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\\r\\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\\r\\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\\r\\nThe frog called after her, \\u2018Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\\r\\nsaid,\\u2019 But she did not stop to hear a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\\r\\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\\r\\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\\r\\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\\r\\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\\r\\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\\r\\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\\r\\nasked her what was the matter. \\u2018There is a nasty frog,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018at\\r\\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\\r\\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\\r\\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\\r\\nin.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king said to the young princess, \\u2018As you have given your word\\r\\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.\\u2019 She did so, and the frog hopped\\r\\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\\r\\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\\r\\nthe princess sat. \\u2018Pray lift me upon chair,\\u2019 said he to the princess,\\r\\n\\u2018and let me sit next to you.\\u2019 As soon as she had done this, the frog\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\\u2019 This\\r\\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \\u2018Now I am\\r\\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\\u2019 And the princess,\\r\\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\\r\\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\\r\\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\\r\\n\\u2018Now, then,\\u2019 thought the princess, \\u2018at last he is gone, and I shall be\\r\\ntroubled with him no more.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\\r\\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\\r\\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\\r\\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\\r\\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\\r\\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\\r\\nof her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\\r\\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\\r\\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\\r\\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \\u2018You,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nprince, \\u2018have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\\r\\nbut that you should go with me into my father\\u2019s kingdom, where I will\\r\\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \\u2018Yes\\u2019 to\\r\\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\\r\\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\\r\\nthe coach rode the prince\\u2019s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\\r\\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\\r\\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\\r\\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\\u2019s\\r\\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\\r\\nmany years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\\r\\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\\r\\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\\r\\n\\u2018But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\\r\\nfrom hunger,\\u2019 said the cat; \\u2018and you, little mouse, cannot venture\\r\\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.\\u2019 The good advice\\r\\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\\r\\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: \\u2018I know no\\r\\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\\r\\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\\r\\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.\\u2019 So the pot was\\r\\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\\r\\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: \\u2018I want to tell you something,\\r\\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\\r\\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\\r\\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\\r\\nafter the house by yourself.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, yes,\\u2019 answered the mouse, \\u2018by all\\r\\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\\r\\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\\u2019 All this,\\r\\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\\r\\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\\r\\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\\r\\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\\r\\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\\r\\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\\r\\n\\u2018Well, here you are again,\\u2019 said the mouse, \\u2018no doubt you have had a\\r\\nmerry day.\\u2019 \\u2018All went off well,\\u2019 answered the cat. \\u2018What name did they\\r\\ngive the child?\\u2019 \\u2018Top off!\\u2019 said the cat quite coolly. \\u2018Top off!\\u2019 cried\\r\\nthe mouse, \\u2018that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\\r\\nyour family?\\u2019 \\u2018What does that matter,\\u2019 said the cat, \\u2018it is no worse\\r\\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\\r\\nthe mouse: \\u2018You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\\r\\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\\r\\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\\u2019 The good mouse consented,\\r\\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\\r\\nhalf the pot of fat. \\u2018Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\\r\\noneself,\\u2019 said she, and was quite satisfied with her day\\u2019s work. When\\r\\nshe went home the mouse inquired: \\u2018And what was the child christened?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Half-done,\\u2019 answered the cat. \\u2018Half-done! What are you saying? I\\r\\nnever heard the name in my life, I\\u2019ll wager anything it is not in the\\r\\ncalendar!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat\\u2019s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \\u2018All good\\r\\nthings go in threes,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I am asked to stand godmother again.\\r\\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\\r\\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\\r\\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won\\u2019t you?\\u2019 \\u2018Top-off!\\r\\nHalf-done!\\u2019 answered the mouse, \\u2018they are such odd names, they make me\\r\\nvery thoughtful.\\u2019 \\u2018You sit at home,\\u2019 said the cat, \\u2018in your dark-grey\\r\\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\\u2019s because\\r\\nyou do not go out in the daytime.\\u2019 During the cat\\u2019s absence the mouse\\r\\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\\r\\nemptied the pot of fat. \\u2018When everything is eaten up one has some\\r\\npeace,\\u2019 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\\r\\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\\r\\nthe third child. \\u2018It will not please you more than the others,\\u2019 said the\\r\\ncat. \\u2018He is called All-gone.\\u2019 \\u2018All-gone,\\u2019 cried the mouse \\u2018that is the\\r\\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\\r\\nwhat can that mean?\\u2019 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\\r\\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\\r\\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: \\u2018Come, cat,\\r\\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\\r\\nshall enjoy that.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 answered the cat, \\u2018you will enjoy it as much\\r\\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\\r\\nwindow.\\u2019 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\\r\\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said the\\r\\nmouse, \\u2018now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\\r\\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\\r\\ntop off, then half-done, then--\\u2019 \\u2018Will you hold your tongue,\\u2019 cried the\\r\\ncat, \\u2018one word more, and I will eat you too.\\u2019 \\u2018All-gone\\u2019 was already on\\r\\nthe poor mouse\\u2019s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\\r\\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\\r\\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\\r\\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\\r\\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\\r\\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\\r\\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\\r\\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\\r\\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\\r\\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\\r\\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\\r\\nher into the bridegroom\\u2019s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\\r\\nNow the princess\\u2019s horse was the fairy\\u2019s gift, and it was called Falada,\\r\\nand could speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\\r\\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\\r\\nand gave it to the princess, and said, \\u2018Take care of it, dear child; for\\r\\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\\u2019 Then they all took\\r\\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\\r\\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\\r\\nbridegroom\\u2019s kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\\r\\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, \\u2018Pray get down, and fetch\\r\\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\\r\\ndrink.\\u2019 \\u2018Nay,\\u2019 said the maid, \\u2018if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\\r\\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\\r\\nlonger.\\u2019 Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\\r\\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\\r\\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, \\u2018Alas! what will become of me?\\u2019\\r\\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\\r\\nmaid\\u2019s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\\r\\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\\r\\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\\u2019s rude\\r\\nspeech, and said, \\u2018Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\\r\\nmy golden cup.\\u2019 But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\\r\\nthan before: \\u2018Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.\\u2019\\r\\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\\r\\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\\r\\n\\u2018What will become of me?\\u2019 And the lock of hair answered her again:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\\r\\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\\r\\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\\r\\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\\r\\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\\r\\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, \\u2018I shall ride upon Falada,\\r\\nand you may have my horse instead\\u2019; so she was forced to give up her\\r\\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\\r\\nmaid\\u2019s shabby ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\\r\\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\\r\\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\\r\\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\\r\\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\\r\\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\\r\\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\\r\\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\\r\\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\\r\\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\\r\\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\\r\\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\\r\\nstanding in the court below. \\u2018I brought her with me for the sake of her\\r\\ncompany on the road,\\u2019 said she; \\u2018pray give the girl some work to do,\\r\\nthat she may not be idle.\\u2019 The old king could not for some time think\\r\\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, \\u2018I have a lad who takes\\r\\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.\\u2019 Now the name of this lad,\\r\\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the king\\u2019s geese, was\\r\\nCurdken.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the false bride said to the prince, \\u2018Dear husband, pray do me one\\r\\npiece of kindness.\\u2019 \\u2018That I will,\\u2019 said the prince. \\u2018Then tell one of\\r\\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\\r\\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road\\u2019; but the truth was,\\r\\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\\r\\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\\r\\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\\r\\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Falada\\u2019s head against a large\\r\\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\\r\\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\\r\\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\\r\\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\\r\\nshe said sorrowfully:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\\r\\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\\r\\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\\r\\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\\r\\nlocks out, but she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken\\u2019s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O\\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl\\u2019d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb\\u2019d and curl\\u2019d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken\\u2019s hat; and\\r\\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\\r\\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\\r\\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\\r\\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\\r\\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\\r\\ngirl looked up at Falada\\u2019s head, and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\\r\\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\\r\\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken\\u2019s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O\\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl\\u2019d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb\\u2019d and curl\\u2019d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\\r\\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\\r\\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\\r\\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\\r\\nlonger.\\u2019 \\u2018Why?\\u2019 said the king. \\u2018Because, instead of doing any good, she\\r\\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.\\u2019 Then the king made him tell him\\r\\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, \\u2018When we go in the morning through\\r\\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\\r\\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answers:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\\r\\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\\r\\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\\r\\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\\r\\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\\r\\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\\r\\nhid himself in a bush by the meadow\\u2019s side; and he soon saw with his own\\r\\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\\r\\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\\r\\nsay:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken\\u2019s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O\\u2019er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl\\u2019d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb\\u2019d and curl\\u2019d!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken\\u2019s hat, and away\\r\\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\\r\\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\\r\\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\\r\\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \\u2018That\\r\\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\\r\\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\\r\\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\\r\\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\\r\\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\\r\\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\\r\\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\\r\\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\\r\\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\\r\\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\\r\\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\\r\\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\\r\\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\\r\\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\\r\\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\\r\\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\\r\\nbehave thus. \\u2018Nothing better,\\u2019 said this false bride, \\u2018than that she\\r\\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\\r\\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\\r\\nstreet till she was dead.\\u2019 \\u2018Thou art she!\\u2019 said the old king; \\u2018and as\\r\\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.\\u2019 And the young\\r\\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\\r\\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\\r\\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The nuts are quite ripe now,\\u2019 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\\r\\n\\u2018suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\\r\\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.\\u2019 \\u2018With all my heart,\\u2019 said\\r\\nPartlet, \\u2018let us go and make a holiday of it together.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\\r\\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\\r\\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\\r\\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\\r\\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\\r\\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\\r\\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\\r\\nhome. \\u2018That\\u2019s a good joke!\\u2019 said Chanticleer; \\u2018no, that will never do;\\r\\nI had rather by half walk home; I\\u2019ll sit on the box and be coachman,\\r\\nif you like, but I\\u2019ll not draw.\\u2019 While this was passing, a duck came\\r\\nquacking up and cried out, \\u2018You thieving vagabonds, what business have\\r\\nyou in my grounds? I\\u2019ll give it you well for your insolence!\\u2019 and upon\\r\\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\\r\\ncoward, and returned the duck\\u2019s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\\r\\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\\r\\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\\r\\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, \\u2018Now,\\r\\nduck, get on as fast as you can.\\u2019 And away they went at a pretty good\\r\\npace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\\r\\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \\u2018Stop, stop!\\u2019\\r\\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\\r\\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\\r\\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\\r\\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\\r\\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\\r\\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\\r\\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\\r\\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\\r\\ntread on Partlet\\u2019s toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\\r\\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\\r\\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\\r\\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\\r\\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\\r\\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\\r\\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\\r\\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\\r\\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\\r\\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\\r\\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\\r\\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\\r\\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\\u2019s easy chair\\r\\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\\r\\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\\r\\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\\r\\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\\r\\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\\r\\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\\r\\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\\r\\n\\u2018Bless me!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018all the world seems to have a design against my\\r\\nhead this morning\\u2019: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\\r\\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\\r\\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\\r\\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\\r\\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\\r\\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\\r\\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\\r\\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\\r\\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\\r\\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, \\u2018Where\\r\\nare you going?\\u2019 And Chanticleer replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018All on our way\\r\\n  A visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cat said, \\u2018Take me with you,\\u2019 Chanticleer said, \\u2018With all my\\r\\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\\r\\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\\r\\n  Now, mice, be ready,\\r\\n  And, wheels, run steady!\\r\\n  For we are going a visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\\r\\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes\\u2019s house, he was not at home; so the mice\\r\\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\\r\\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\\r\\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\\r\\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\\r\\nup in the towel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\\r\\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\\r\\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\\r\\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\\r\\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\\r\\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\\r\\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\\r\\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\\r\\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\\r\\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\\r\\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\\r\\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\\r\\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\\r\\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\\r\\nChanticleer, \\u2018Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\\r\\nshall be choked.\\u2019 Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\\r\\nwill be choked by a great nut.\\u2019 The river said, \\u2018Run first to the bride,\\r\\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.\\u2019 Chanticleer ran to\\r\\nthe bride, and said, \\u2018Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\\r\\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\\r\\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.\\u2019 But the bride\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\\r\\nin the garden.\\u2019 Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\\r\\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\\r\\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\\r\\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\\r\\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\\r\\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\\r\\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\\r\\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\\r\\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\\r\\nmet the fox. \\u2018Where are you going, Chanticleer?\\u2019 said he. \\u2018To bury my\\r\\nPartlet,\\u2019 said the other. \\u2018May I go with you?\\u2019 said the fox. \\u2018Yes; but\\r\\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \\u2018How shall we get\\r\\nover?\\u2019 said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \\u2018I will lay myself across,\\r\\nand you may pass over upon me.\\u2019 But as the mice were going over, the\\r\\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\\r\\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\\r\\nand said, \\u2018I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\\r\\nshall pass over upon me.\\u2019 So he laid himself down; but they managed\\r\\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\\r\\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\\r\\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\\r\\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\\r\\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\\r\\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\\r\\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\\r\\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\\r\\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\\r\\ndied too; and so all were dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRAPUNZEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\\r\\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\\r\\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\\r\\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\\r\\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\\r\\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\\r\\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\\r\\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\\r\\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\\r\\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\\r\\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\\r\\nasked: \\u2018What ails you, dear wife?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 she replied, \\u2018if I can\\u2019t eat\\r\\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\\r\\ndie.\\u2019 The man, who loved her, thought: \\u2018Sooner than let your wife die,\\r\\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\\u2019\\r\\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\\r\\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\\r\\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\\r\\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\\r\\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\\r\\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\\r\\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\\r\\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\\r\\nhim. \\u2018How can you dare,\\u2019 said she with angry look, \\u2018descend into my\\r\\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Ah,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\\r\\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\\r\\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\\r\\nhad not got some to eat.\\u2019 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\\r\\nsoftened, and said to him: \\u2018If the case be as you say, I will allow\\r\\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\\r\\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\\r\\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\\r\\nmother.\\u2019 The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\\r\\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\\r\\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\\r\\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\\r\\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\\r\\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\\r\\nbeneath it and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\\r\\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\\r\\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\\r\\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\\u2019s son rode through\\r\\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\\r\\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\\r\\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\\u2019s\\r\\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\\r\\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\\r\\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\\r\\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\\r\\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\\r\\nclimbed up to her. \\u2018If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\\r\\nwill try my fortune,\\u2019 said he, and the next day when it began to grow\\r\\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\\u2019s son climbed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\\r\\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\\u2019s son began to talk to\\r\\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\\r\\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\\r\\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\\r\\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\\r\\nthought: \\u2018He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\\u2019; and she said\\r\\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: \\u2018I will willingly go away with\\r\\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\\r\\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\\r\\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\\u2019 They\\r\\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\\r\\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\\r\\nonce Rapunzel said to her: \\u2018Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\\r\\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\\u2019s son--he\\r\\nis with me in a moment.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah! you wicked child,\\u2019 cried the enchantress.\\r\\n\\u2018What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\\r\\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!\\u2019 In her anger she clutched\\r\\nRapunzel\\u2019s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\\r\\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\\r\\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\\r\\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\\r\\ngrief and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\\r\\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\\r\\nwindow, and when the king\\u2019s son came and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nshe let the hair down. The king\\u2019s son ascended, but instead of finding\\r\\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\\r\\nwicked and venomous looks. \\u2018Aha!\\u2019 she cried mockingly, \\u2018you would fetch\\r\\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\\r\\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\\r\\nlost to you; you will never see her again.\\u2019 The king\\u2019s son was beside\\r\\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\\r\\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\\r\\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\\r\\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\\r\\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\\r\\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\\r\\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\\r\\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\\r\\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\\r\\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\\r\\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\\r\\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\\r\\ncontented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFUNDEVOGEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\\r\\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\\r\\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\\r\\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\\r\\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\\r\\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\\r\\n\\u2018You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.\\u2019 He\\r\\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\\r\\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\\r\\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\\r\\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\\r\\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\\r\\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, \\u2018Listen, old Sanna, why are you\\r\\nfetching so much water?\\u2019 \\u2018If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\\r\\ntell you why.\\u2019 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\\r\\nand then the cook said: \\u2018Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\\r\\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\\r\\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\\r\\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\\r\\n\\u2018If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.\\u2019 Fundevogel\\r\\nsaid: \\u2018Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.\\u2019 Then said Lina: \\u2018Then\\r\\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\\r\\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\\r\\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\\r\\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\\r\\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\\r\\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\\r\\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\\r\\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\\r\\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\\r\\nalarmed, and she said to herself: \\u2018What shall I say now when the\\r\\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\\r\\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\\r\\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\\r\\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\\r\\nsaid to Fundevogel: \\u2018Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\\u2019\\r\\nFundevogel said: \\u2018Neither now, nor ever.\\u2019 Then said Lina: \\u2018Do you become\\r\\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.\\u2019 When the three servants came to\\r\\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\\r\\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: \\u2018There is nothing to be done\\r\\nhere,\\u2019 and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\\r\\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\\r\\nold cook scolded and said: \\u2018You simpletons, you should have cut the\\r\\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\\r\\nyou; go, and do it at once.\\u2019 They had therefore to go out and look for\\r\\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\\r\\nThen Lina said: \\u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\\r\\nyou.\\u2019 Fundevogel said: \\u2018Neither now; nor ever.\\u2019 Said Lina: \\u2018Then do you\\r\\nbecome a church, and I\\u2019ll be the chandelier in it.\\u2019 So when the three\\r\\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\\r\\nit. They said therefore to each other: \\u2018What can we do here, let us go\\r\\nhome.\\u2019 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\\r\\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\\r\\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: \\u2018You fools! why\\r\\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\\r\\nwith you?\\u2019 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\\r\\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\\r\\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\\r\\nafter them. Then said Lina: \\u2018Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\\r\\nnever leave you.\\u2019 Then said Fundevogel: \\u2018Neither now, nor ever.\\u2019\\r\\nSaid Lina: \\u2018Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\\u2019 The cook,\\r\\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\\r\\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\\r\\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\\r\\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\\r\\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne summer\\u2019s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\\r\\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\\r\\na peasant woman down the street crying: \\u2018Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\\r\\ncheap!\\u2019 This rang pleasantly in the tailor\\u2019s ears; he stretched his\\r\\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: \\u2018Come up here, dear woman;\\r\\nhere you will get rid of your goods.\\u2019 The woman came up the three steps\\r\\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\\r\\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\\r\\nat length said: \\u2018The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\\r\\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\\r\\nconsequence.\\u2019 The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\\r\\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. \\u2018Now, this jam\\r\\nshall be blessed by God,\\u2019 cried the little tailor, \\u2018and give me health\\r\\nand strength\\u2019; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\\r\\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. \\u2018This won\\u2019t\\r\\ntaste bitter,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but I will just finish the jacket before I\\r\\ntake a bite.\\u2019 He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\\r\\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\\r\\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\\r\\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. \\u2018Hi! who invited you?\\u2019 said the\\r\\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\\r\\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\\r\\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\\r\\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\\r\\nand saying: \\u2018Wait, and I will give it to you,\\u2019 struck it mercilessly on\\r\\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\\r\\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. \\u2018Are you a fellow of that\\r\\nsort?\\u2019 said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. \\u2018The whole\\r\\ntown shall know of this!\\u2019 And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\\r\\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: \\u2018Seven at\\r\\none stroke!\\u2019 \\u2018What, the town!\\u2019 he continued, \\u2018the whole world shall hear\\r\\nof it!\\u2019 and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb\\u2019s tail. The tailor\\r\\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\\r\\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\\r\\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\\r\\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\\r\\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\\r\\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\\r\\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\\r\\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\\r\\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\\r\\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\\r\\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\\r\\nHave you any inclination to go with me?\\u2019 The giant looked contemptuously\\r\\nat the tailor, and said: \\u2018You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Oh, indeed?\\u2019 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\\r\\nshowed the giant the girdle, \\u2018there may you read what kind of a man I\\r\\nam!\\u2019 The giant read: \\u2018Seven at one stroke,\\u2019 and thought that they had\\r\\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\\r\\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\\r\\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\\r\\nof it. \\u2018Do that likewise,\\u2019 said the giant, \\u2018if you have strength.\\u2019 \\u2018Is\\r\\nthat all?\\u2019 said the tailor, \\u2018that is child\\u2019s play with us!\\u2019 and put his\\r\\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\\r\\nthe liquid ran out of it. \\u2018Faith,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018that was a little better,\\r\\nwasn\\u2019t it?\\u2019 The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\\r\\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\\r\\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. \\u2018Now, little mite of a man, do\\r\\nthat likewise,\\u2019 \\u2018Well thrown,\\u2019 said the tailor, \\u2018but after all the stone\\r\\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\\r\\nback at all,\\u2019 and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\\r\\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\\r\\nrose, flew away and did not come back. \\u2018How does that shot please you,\\r\\ncomrade?\\u2019 asked the tailor. \\u2018You can certainly throw,\\u2019 said the giant,\\r\\n\\u2018but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.\\u2019 He\\r\\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\\r\\nthe ground, and said: \\u2018If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\\r\\ntree out of the forest.\\u2019 \\u2018Readily,\\u2019 answered the little man; \\u2018take you\\r\\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\\r\\nafter all, they are the heaviest.\\u2019 The giant took the trunk on his\\r\\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\\r\\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\\r\\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\\r\\nwhistled the song: \\u2018Three tailors rode forth from the gate,\\u2019 as if\\r\\ncarrying the tree were child\\u2019s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\\r\\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: \\u2018Hark\\r\\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!\\u2019 The tailor sprang nimbly down,\\r\\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\\r\\nto the giant: \\u2018You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\\r\\nthe tree!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\\r\\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\\r\\ndown, gave it into the tailor\\u2019s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\\r\\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\\r\\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\\r\\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \\u2018What is\\r\\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\\u2019 \\u2018There is no\\r\\nlack of strength,\\u2019 answered the little tailor. \\u2018Do you think that could\\r\\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\\r\\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\\r\\nJump as I did, if you can do it.\\u2019 The giant made the attempt but he\\r\\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\\r\\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant said: \\u2018If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\\r\\ncavern and spend the night with us.\\u2019 The little tailor was willing, and\\r\\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\\r\\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\\r\\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \\u2018It is much\\r\\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.\\u2019 The giant showed him a bed, and\\r\\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\\r\\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\\r\\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\\r\\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\\r\\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\\r\\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\\r\\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\\r\\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\\r\\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\\r\\ngreat hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\\r\\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\\r\\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\\r\\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\\r\\nread on his girdle: \\u2018Seven at one stroke.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said they, \\u2018what does\\r\\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\\r\\nlord.\\u2019 They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\\r\\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\\r\\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\\r\\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\\r\\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\\r\\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\\r\\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. \\u2018For this very reason have\\r\\nI come here,\\u2019 the tailor replied, \\u2018I am ready to enter the king\\u2019s\\r\\nservice.\\u2019 He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\\r\\nwas assigned him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\\r\\nhim a thousand miles away. \\u2018What is to be the end of this?\\u2019 they said\\r\\namong themselves. \\u2018If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\\r\\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\\r\\nhim.\\u2019 They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\\r\\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. \\u2018We are not prepared,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthey, \\u2018to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\\u2019 The king was\\r\\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\\r\\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\\r\\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\\r\\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\\r\\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\\r\\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\\r\\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\\r\\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\\r\\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\\r\\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\\r\\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\\r\\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\\r\\n\\u2018That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!\\u2019 thought the\\r\\nlittle tailor. \\u2018One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\\r\\nkingdom every day of one\\u2019s life!\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, yes,\\u2019 he replied, \\u2018I will soon\\r\\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\\r\\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\\r\\ntwo.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\\r\\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\\r\\n\\u2018Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\\r\\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\\r\\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\\r\\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\\r\\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\\r\\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\\r\\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\\r\\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \\u2018Why are you\\r\\nknocking me?\\u2019 \\u2018You must be dreaming,\\u2019 said the other, \\u2018I am not knocking\\r\\nyou.\\u2019 They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\\r\\nthrew a stone down on the second. \\u2018What is the meaning of this?\\u2019 cried\\r\\nthe other \\u2018Why are you pelting me?\\u2019 \\u2018I am not pelting you,\\u2019 answered\\r\\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\\r\\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\\r\\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\\r\\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. \\u2018That\\r\\nis too bad!\\u2019 cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\\r\\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\\r\\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\\r\\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\\r\\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. \\u2018It is\\r\\na lucky thing,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018that they did not tear up the tree on which\\r\\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\\r\\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\\u2019 He drew out his sword and gave\\r\\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\\r\\nhorsemen and said: \\u2018The work is done; I have finished both of them\\r\\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\\r\\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\\r\\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\\u2019 \\u2018But are you not\\r\\nwounded?\\u2019 asked the horsemen. \\u2018You need not concern yourself about\\r\\nthat,\\u2019 answered the tailor, \\u2018they have not bent one hair of mine.\\u2019 The\\r\\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\\r\\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\\r\\ntorn-up trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\\r\\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\\r\\nrid of the hero. \\u2018Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\\r\\nkingdom,\\u2019 said he to him, \\u2018you must perform one more heroic deed. In\\r\\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\\r\\nit first.\\u2019 \\u2018I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\\r\\nblow, is my kind of affair.\\u2019 He took a rope and an axe with him, went\\r\\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\\r\\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\\r\\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\\r\\nhorn without more ado. \\u2018Softly, softly; it can\\u2019t be done as quickly as\\r\\nthat,\\u2019 said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\\r\\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\\r\\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\\r\\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\\r\\nwas caught. \\u2018Now, I have got the bird,\\u2019 said the tailor, and came out\\r\\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\\r\\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\\r\\nbeast away and took it to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\\r\\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\\r\\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\\r\\nhelp. \\u2018Willingly,\\u2019 said the tailor, \\u2018that is child\\u2019s play!\\u2019 He did not\\r\\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\\r\\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\\r\\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\\r\\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\\r\\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\\r\\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\\r\\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\\r\\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\\r\\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\\r\\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\\r\\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\\r\\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\\r\\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\\r\\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\\r\\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\\r\\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\\r\\nking was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\\r\\nnight: \\u2018Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\\r\\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.\\u2019 Then she discovered in what\\r\\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\\r\\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\\r\\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\\r\\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\\r\\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\\r\\nworld.\\u2019 The woman was satisfied with this; but the king\\u2019s armour-bearer,\\r\\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\\r\\nthe whole plot. \\u2018I\\u2019ll put a screw into that business,\\u2019 said the little\\r\\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\\r\\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\\r\\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\\r\\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: \\u2018Boy, make me the doublet\\r\\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\\r\\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\\r\\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\\r\\noutside the room.\\u2019 When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\\r\\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\\r\\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\\r\\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\\r\\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\\r\\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\\r\\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\\r\\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\\r\\ngroaned and said to his wife: \\u2018What is to become of us? How are we\\r\\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\\r\\nourselves?\\u2019 \\u2018I\\u2019ll tell you what, husband,\\u2019 answered the woman, \\u2018early\\r\\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\\r\\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\\r\\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\\r\\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\\r\\nrid of them.\\u2019 \\u2018No, wife,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018I will not do that; how can I\\r\\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\\r\\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.\\u2019 \\u2018O, you fool!\\u2019 said she, \\u2018then we\\r\\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\\r\\ncoffins,\\u2019 and she left him no peace until he consented. \\u2018But I feel very\\r\\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,\\u2019 said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\\r\\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\\r\\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: \\u2018Now all is over with us.\\u2019 \\u2018Be quiet,\\r\\nGretel,\\u2019 said Hansel, \\u2018do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\\r\\nto help us.\\u2019 And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\\r\\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\\r\\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\\r\\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\\r\\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\\r\\nback and said to Gretel: \\u2018Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\\r\\npeace, God will not forsake us,\\u2019 and he lay down again in his bed. When\\r\\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\\r\\ntwo children, saying: \\u2018Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\\r\\nforest to fetch wood.\\u2019 She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\\r\\n\\u2018There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\\r\\nfor you will get nothing else.\\u2019 Gretel took the bread under her apron,\\r\\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\\r\\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\\r\\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\\r\\nHis father said: \\u2018Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\\r\\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\r\\nfather,\\u2019 said Hansel, \\u2018I am looking at my little white cat, which is\\r\\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\\u2019 The wife said:\\r\\n\\u2018Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\\r\\nshining on the chimneys.\\u2019 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\\r\\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\\r\\nout of his pocket on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \\u2018Now,\\r\\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\\r\\nbe cold.\\u2019 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\\r\\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\\r\\nvery high, the woman said: \\u2018Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\\r\\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\\r\\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\\r\\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\\r\\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\\r\\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\\r\\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\\r\\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\\r\\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\\r\\nsaid: \\u2018How are we to get out of the forest now?\\u2019 But Hansel comforted\\r\\nher and said: \\u2018Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\\r\\nwill soon find the way.\\u2019 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\\r\\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\\r\\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\\r\\nto their father\\u2019s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\\r\\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \\u2018You naughty\\r\\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\\r\\nnever coming back at all!\\u2019 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\\r\\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\\r\\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\\r\\nfather: \\u2018Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\\r\\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\\r\\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\\r\\nmeans of saving ourselves!\\u2019 The man\\u2019s heart was heavy, and he thought:\\r\\n\\u2018It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\\r\\nchildren.\\u2019 The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\\r\\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\\r\\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\\r\\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\\r\\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\\r\\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\\r\\nlittle sister, and said: \\u2018Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\\r\\ngood God will help us.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\\r\\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\\r\\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\\r\\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\\r\\n\\u2018Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\\u2019 said the father, \\u2018go on.\\u2019 \\u2018I\\r\\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\\r\\nwants to say goodbye to me,\\u2019 answered Hansel. \\u2018Fool!\\u2019 said the woman,\\r\\n\\u2018that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\\r\\non the chimney.\\u2019 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\\r\\non the path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\\r\\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\\r\\nthe mother said: \\u2018Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\\r\\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\\r\\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\\u2019 When\\r\\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\\r\\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\\r\\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\\r\\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \\u2018Just wait,\\r\\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\\r\\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\\u2019 When\\r\\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\\r\\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\\r\\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: \\u2018We shall soon find the way,\\u2019 but\\r\\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\\r\\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\\r\\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\\r\\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\\r\\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father\\u2019s house. They\\r\\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\\r\\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\\r\\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\\r\\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\\r\\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\\r\\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\\r\\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\\r\\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\\r\\nwere of clear sugar. \\u2018We will set to work on that,\\u2019 said Hansel, \\u2018and\\r\\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\\r\\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.\\u2019 Hansel reached up above, and\\r\\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\\r\\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\\r\\nfrom the parlour:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\\r\\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018The wind, the wind,\\r\\n  The heaven-born wind,\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\\r\\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\\r\\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\\r\\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\\r\\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\\r\\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\\r\\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \\u2018Oh, you dear\\r\\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\\r\\nharm shall happen to you.\\u2019 She took them both by the hand, and led them\\r\\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\\r\\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\\r\\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\\r\\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\\r\\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\\r\\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\\r\\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\\r\\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\\r\\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\\r\\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\\r\\nmalice, and said mockingly: \\u2018I have them, they shall not escape me\\r\\nagain!\\u2019 Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\\r\\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\\r\\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: \\u2018That\\r\\nwill be a dainty mouthful!\\u2019 Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\\r\\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\\r\\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\\r\\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: \\u2018Get up, lazy thing, fetch\\r\\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\\r\\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\\u2019\\r\\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\\r\\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\\r\\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\\r\\ncried: \\u2018Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\\r\\nbe fat.\\u2019 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\\r\\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\\r\\nHansel\\u2019s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\\r\\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\\r\\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \\u2018Now, then,\\r\\nGretel,\\u2019 she cried to the girl, \\u2018stir yourself, and bring some water.\\r\\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.\\u2019 Ah,\\r\\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\\r\\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! \\u2018Dear God, do help us,\\u2019 she\\r\\ncried. \\u2018If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\\r\\nat any rate have died together.\\u2019 \\u2018Just keep your noise to yourself,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the old woman, \\u2018it won\\u2019t help you at all.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\\r\\nthe water, and light the fire. \\u2018We will bake first,\\u2019 said the old woman,\\r\\n\\u2018I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\\u2019 She pushed poor\\r\\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\\r\\n\\u2018Creep in,\\u2019 said the witch, \\u2018and see if it is properly heated, so that\\r\\nwe can put the bread in.\\u2019 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\\r\\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\\r\\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \\u2018I do not know how I am\\r\\nto do it; how do I get in?\\u2019 \\u2018Silly goose,\\u2019 said the old woman. \\u2018The door\\r\\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\\u2019 and she crept up and\\r\\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\\r\\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\\r\\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\\r\\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\\r\\nand cried: \\u2018Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\\u2019 Then Hansel\\r\\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\\r\\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\\r\\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch\\u2019s\\r\\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\\r\\n\\u2018These are far better than pebbles!\\u2019 said Hansel, and thrust into his\\r\\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: \\u2018I, too, will take\\r\\nsomething home with me,\\u2019 and filled her pinafore full. \\u2018But now we must\\r\\nbe off,\\u2019 said Hansel, \\u2018that we may get out of the witch\\u2019s forest.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\\r\\nwater. \\u2018We cannot cross,\\u2019 said Hansel, \\u2018I see no foot-plank, and no\\r\\nbridge.\\u2019 \\u2018And there is also no ferry,\\u2019 answered Gretel, \\u2018but a white\\r\\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.\\u2019 Then she\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\\r\\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\\r\\n  There\\u2019s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\\r\\n  Take us across on thy back so white.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\\r\\nhis sister to sit by him. \\u2018No,\\u2019 replied Gretel, \\u2018that will be too heavy\\r\\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\\u2019 The\\r\\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\\r\\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\\r\\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father\\u2019s house. Then\\r\\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\\r\\ntheir father\\u2019s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\\r\\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\\r\\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\\r\\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\\r\\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\\r\\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\\r\\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\\r\\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\\r\\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\\r\\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird\\u2019s duty was to fly daily into the\\r\\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\\r\\nto the cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\\r\\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\\r\\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\\r\\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\\r\\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\\r\\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\\r\\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\\r\\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\\r\\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\\r\\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\\r\\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\\r\\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\\r\\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\\r\\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\\r\\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\\r\\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\\r\\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\\r\\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\\r\\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\\r\\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\\r\\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\\r\\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\\r\\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\\r\\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\\r\\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\\r\\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\\r\\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\\r\\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\\r\\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\\r\\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\\r\\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\\r\\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\\r\\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\\r\\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\\r\\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\\r\\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\\r\\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\\r\\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\\r\\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\\r\\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\\r\\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\\r\\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\\r\\nto recover himself, he was drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER HOLLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\\r\\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\\r\\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\\r\\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\\r\\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\\r\\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\\r\\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\\r\\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\\r\\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\\r\\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\\r\\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\\r\\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, \\u2018As you have let the spindle fall\\r\\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\\r\\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\\r\\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\\r\\nin every direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker\\u2019s oven\\r\\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, \\u2018Take us out, take us\\r\\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\\r\\nago.\\u2019 So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\\r\\n\\u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray,\\u2019 cried the tree; \\u2018my apples, one and all,\\r\\nare ripe.\\u2019 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\\r\\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\\r\\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\\r\\nheap and walked on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\\r\\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\\r\\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, \\u2018What are you\\r\\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\\r\\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\\r\\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\\r\\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\\r\\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.\\u2019 The old woman\\r\\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\\r\\ninto her service.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman\\u2019s bidding and\\r\\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\\r\\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\\r\\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\\r\\nboiled meats every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\\r\\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\\r\\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\\r\\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\\r\\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\\r\\nto Mother Holle and said, \\u2018I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\\r\\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\\r\\npeople.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Mother Holle said, \\u2018I am pleased that you should want to go back\\r\\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\\r\\nwill take you home myself.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\\r\\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\\r\\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\\r\\nhead to foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018That is a reward for your industry,\\u2019 said Mother Holle, and as she\\r\\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\\r\\nworld close to her mother\\u2019s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\\r\\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your golden daughter\\u2019s come back to you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\\r\\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\\r\\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\\r\\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\\r\\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\\r\\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\\r\\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\\r\\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\\r\\ntill she came to the oven. \\u2018Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\\r\\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\\u2019 cried the loaves\\r\\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, \\u2018Do you think I am going to dirty\\r\\nmy hands for you?\\u2019 and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. \\u2018Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\\r\\napples, one and all, are ripe,\\u2019 it cried. But she only answered, \\u2018A nice\\r\\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\\u2019 and\\r\\npassed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she came to Mother Holle\\u2019s house, and as she had heard all about\\r\\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\\r\\nherself without delay to the old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\\r\\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\\r\\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\\r\\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\\r\\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\\r\\nmake the old woman\\u2019s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\\r\\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\\r\\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\\r\\nthought to herself, \\u2018The gold will soon be mine.\\u2019 Mother Holle led her,\\r\\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\\r\\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\\r\\npouring over her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018That is in return for your services,\\u2019 said the old woman, and she shut\\r\\nthe gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\\r\\nwell called out as she saw her:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your dirty daughter\\u2019s come back to you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\\r\\nher as long as she lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\\r\\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\\r\\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\\r\\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\\r\\nwear anything else; so she was always called \\u2018Little Red-Cap.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day her mother said to her: \\u2018Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\\r\\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\\r\\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\\r\\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\\r\\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\\r\\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don\\u2019t forget to say, \\u201cGood\\r\\nmorning\\u201d, and don\\u2019t peep into every corner before you do it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I will take great care,\\u2019 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\\r\\nher hand on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\\r\\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\\r\\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Good day, Little Red-Cap,\\u2019 said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Thank you kindly, wolf.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018To my grandmother\\u2019s.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What have you got in your apron?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\\r\\nhave something good, to make her stronger.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\\r\\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\\r\\nsurely must know it,\\u2019 replied Little Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf thought to himself: \\u2018What a tender young creature! what a nice\\r\\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\\r\\nact craftily, so as to catch both.\\u2019 So he walked for a short time by\\r\\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: \\u2018See, Little Red-Cap, how\\r\\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\\r\\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\\r\\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\\r\\nout here in the wood is merry.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\\r\\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\\r\\nshe thought: \\u2018Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\\r\\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\\r\\nin good time\\u2019; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\\r\\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\\r\\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\\u2019s house and knocked\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Who is there?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Little Red-Cap,\\u2019 replied the wolf. \\u2018She is bringing cake and wine; open\\r\\nthe door.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Lift the latch,\\u2019 called out the grandmother, \\u2018I am too weak, and cannot\\r\\nget up.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\\r\\nword he went straight to the grandmother\\u2019s bed, and devoured her. Then\\r\\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\\r\\nand drew the curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\\r\\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\\r\\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\\r\\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\\r\\nherself: \\u2018Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\\r\\nbeing with grandmother so much.\\u2019 She called out: \\u2018Good morning,\\u2019 but\\r\\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\\r\\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\\r\\nlooking very strange.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Oh! grandmother,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018what big ears you have!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The better to hear you with, my child,\\u2019 was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\\u2019 she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The better to see you with, my dear.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The better to hug you with.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The better to eat you with!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\\r\\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\\r\\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\\r\\nthe house, and thought to himself: \\u2018How the old woman is snoring! I must\\r\\njust see if she wants anything.\\u2019 So he went into the room, and when he\\r\\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \\u2018Do I find you\\r\\nhere, you old sinner!\\u2019 said he. \\u2018I have long sought you!\\u2019 Then just as\\r\\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\\r\\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\\r\\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\\r\\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\\r\\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\\r\\nsprang out, crying: \\u2018Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\\r\\ninside the wolf\\u2019; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\\r\\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\\r\\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf\\u2019s belly, and when he awoke,\\r\\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\\r\\nonce, and fell dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\\u2019s skin and\\r\\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\\r\\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \\u2018As\\r\\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\\r\\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\\r\\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\\r\\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\\r\\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\\r\\nhad said \\u2018good morning\\u2019 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\\r\\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\\r\\nhave eaten her up. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the grandmother, \\u2018we will shut the door,\\r\\nthat he may not come in.\\u2019 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\\r\\n\\u2018Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\\r\\nsome cakes.\\u2019 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\\r\\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\\r\\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\\r\\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\\r\\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\\r\\ntrough, so she said to the child: \\u2018Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\\r\\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\\r\\ntrough.\\u2019 Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\\r\\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\\r\\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\\r\\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\\r\\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\\r\\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\\r\\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\\r\\nfor. He said to himself, \\u2018I will give her to the first suitable man who\\r\\ncomes and asks for her hand.\\u2019 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\\r\\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\\r\\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\\r\\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\\r\\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\\r\\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \\u2018You\\r\\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\\r\\ntime.\\u2019 \\u2018I do not know where your house is,\\u2019 she answered. \\u2018My house is\\r\\nout there in the dark forest,\\u2019 he said. She tried to excuse herself by\\r\\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\\r\\nonly replied, \\u2018You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\\r\\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\\r\\nwill strew ashes along the path.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\\r\\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\\r\\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\\r\\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\\r\\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\\r\\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\\r\\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\\r\\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\\r\\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\\r\\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\\r\\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers\\u2019 lair.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\\r\\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers\\u2019 lair.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\\r\\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\\r\\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\\r\\nshaking. \\u2018Can you tell me,\\u2019 asked the girl, \\u2018if my betrothed husband\\r\\nlives here?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Ah, you poor child,\\u2019 answered the old woman, \\u2018what a place for you to\\r\\ncome to! This is a murderers\\u2019 den. You think yourself a promised bride,\\r\\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\\r\\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\\r\\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\\r\\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\\r\\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\\r\\nyou, you would be lost.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\\r\\nfrom view. \\u2018Keep as still as a mouse,\\u2019 she said; \\u2018do not move or speak,\\r\\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\\r\\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\\r\\nopportunity to escape.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\\r\\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\\r\\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\\r\\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\\r\\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\\r\\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\\r\\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\\r\\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\\r\\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\\r\\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\\r\\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\\r\\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\\r\\ncould not find it. \\u2018Have you looked behind the large cask?\\u2019 said one of\\r\\nthe others. But the old woman called out, \\u2018Come and eat your suppers,\\r\\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won\\u2019t run away.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The old woman is right,\\u2019 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\\r\\nthe finger and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\\r\\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\\r\\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\\r\\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\\r\\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\\r\\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\\r\\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers\\u2019\\r\\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\\r\\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\\r\\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\\r\\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\\r\\nall that had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\\r\\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\\r\\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\\r\\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\\r\\nnot say a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018And you, my love,\\u2019 said the bridegroom, turning to her, \\u2018is there no\\r\\ntale you know? Tell us something.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I will tell you a dream, then,\\u2019 said the bride. \\u2018I went alone through a\\r\\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\\r\\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers\\u2019 lair.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nand again a second time it said these words.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\\r\\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\\r\\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\\r\\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\\r\\n\\u201cAh, you poor child, you are come to a murderers\\u2019 den; your betrothed\\r\\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\\r\\ncook and eat you.\\u201d\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\\r\\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\\r\\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\\r\\nyellow, and with that she died.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018My darling, this is only a dream.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\\r\\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\\r\\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\\r\\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.\\u2019 And\\r\\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\\r\\nassembled guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\\r\\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\\r\\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\\r\\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTOM THUMB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\\r\\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. \\u2018How lonely it is,\\r\\nwife,\\u2019 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, \\u2018for you and me\\r\\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\\r\\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018What you say is very true,\\u2019 said the wife, sighing, and turning round\\r\\nher wheel; \\u2018how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\\r\\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\\r\\nhappy, and love it dearly.\\u2019 Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\\r\\npass that this good woman\\u2019s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\\r\\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\\r\\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\\r\\nthey said, \\u2018Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\\r\\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.\\u2019 And they called him Thomas\\r\\nThumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\\r\\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\\r\\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\\r\\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\\r\\nfuel, he said, \\u2018I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\\r\\nwant to make haste.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, father,\\u2019 cried Tom, \\u2018I will take care of that;\\r\\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\\u2019 Then the woodman\\r\\nlaughed, and said, \\u2018How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\\u2019s\\r\\nbridle.\\u2019 \\u2018Never mind that, father,\\u2019 said Tom; \\u2018if my mother will only\\r\\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\\r\\ngo.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the father, \\u2018we will try for once.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\\r\\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\\r\\nto go, crying out, \\u2018Go on!\\u2019 and \\u2018Stop!\\u2019 as he wanted: and thus the horse\\r\\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\\r\\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\\r\\nwas calling out, \\u2018Gently! gently!\\u2019 two strangers came up. \\u2018What an odd\\r\\nthing that is!\\u2019 said one: \\u2018there is a cart going along, and I hear a\\r\\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.\\u2019 \\u2018That is queer,\\r\\nindeed,\\u2019 said the other; \\u2018let us follow the cart, and see where it\\r\\ngoes.\\u2019 So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\\r\\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\\r\\nout, \\u2018See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\\r\\nme down!\\u2019 So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\\r\\nthe other took his son out of the horse\\u2019s ear, and put him down upon a\\r\\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\\r\\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, \\u2018That\\r\\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\\r\\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.\\u2019 So they went up to\\r\\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. \\u2018He\\r\\nwill be better off,\\u2019 said they, \\u2018with us than with you.\\u2019 \\u2018I won\\u2019t sell\\r\\nhim at all,\\u2019 said the father; \\u2018my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\\r\\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.\\u2019 But Tom, hearing of the\\r\\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father\\u2019s coat to his shoulder\\r\\nand whispered in his ear, \\u2018Take the money, father, and let them have me;\\r\\nI\\u2019ll soon come back to you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\\r\\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. \\u2018Where would you like to\\r\\nsit?\\u2019 said one of them. \\u2018Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\\r\\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\\r\\ngo along.\\u2019 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\\r\\nfather they took him away with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Let me get down, I\\u2019m tired.\\u2019 So the man took off his hat, and\\r\\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\\r\\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\\r\\nan old mouse-hole. \\u2018Good night, my masters!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I\\u2019m off! mind and\\r\\nlook sharp after me the next time.\\u2019 Then they ran at once to the place,\\r\\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\\r\\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\\r\\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\\r\\nsulky as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. \\u2018What\\r\\ndangerous walking it is,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018in this ploughed field! If I were to\\r\\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.\\u2019\\r\\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. \\u2018This is\\r\\nlucky,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I can sleep here very well\\u2019; and in he crept.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\\r\\ntogether; and one said to the other, \\u2018How can we rob that rich parson\\u2019s\\r\\nhouse of his silver and gold?\\u2019 \\u2018I\\u2019ll tell you!\\u2019 cried Tom. \\u2018What noise\\r\\nwas that?\\u2019 said the thief, frightened; \\u2018I\\u2019m sure I heard someone speak.\\u2019\\r\\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, \\u2018Take me with you, and I\\u2019ll\\r\\nsoon show you how to get the parson\\u2019s money.\\u2019 \\u2018But where are you?\\u2019 said\\r\\nthey. \\u2018Look about on the ground,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018and listen where the\\r\\nsound comes from.\\u2019 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\\r\\nup in their hands. \\u2018You little urchin!\\u2019 they said, \\u2018what can you do for\\r\\nus?\\u2019 \\u2018Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson\\u2019s house,\\r\\nand throw you out whatever you want.\\u2019 \\u2018That\\u2019s a good thought,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nthieves; \\u2018come along, we shall see what you can do.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the parson\\u2019s house, Tom slipped through the\\r\\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\\r\\n\\u2018Will you have all that is here?\\u2019 At this the thieves were frightened,\\r\\nand said, \\u2018Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\\u2019\\r\\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\\r\\n\\u2018How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\\u2019 Now the cook lay in\\r\\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\\r\\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\\r\\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \\u2018The little\\r\\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.\\u2019 So they came back and\\r\\nwhispered softly to him, saying, \\u2018Now let us have no more of your\\r\\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.\\u2019 Then Tom called out\\r\\nas loud as he could, \\u2018Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\\r\\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\\r\\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\\r\\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\\r\\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\\r\\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\\r\\neyes open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\\r\\nplace to finish his night\\u2019s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\\r\\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\\r\\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\\r\\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\\r\\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\\r\\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\\r\\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\\r\\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\\r\\ncow\\u2019s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. \\u2018Good\\r\\nlack-a-day!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018how came I to tumble into the mill?\\u2019 But he soon\\r\\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\\r\\nhim, that he might not get between the cow\\u2019s teeth, and so be crushed to\\r\\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. \\u2018It is rather dark,\\u2019 said\\r\\nhe; \\u2018they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\\r\\ncandle would be no bad thing.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\\r\\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\\r\\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\\r\\ncried out as loud as he could, \\u2018Don\\u2019t bring me any more hay! Don\\u2019t bring\\r\\nme any more hay!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\\r\\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\\r\\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\\r\\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\\r\\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\\r\\nparson, and said, \\u2018Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\\u2019 But the parson\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Woman, thou art surely mad!\\u2019 However, he went with her into the\\r\\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, \\u2018Don\\u2019t\\r\\nbring me any more hay!\\u2019 Then the parson himself was frightened; and\\r\\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\\r\\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\\r\\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\\r\\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\\r\\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\\r\\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\\r\\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\\r\\nout, \\u2018My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\\u2019 \\u2018Where\\u2019s that?\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the wolf. \\u2018In such and such a house,\\u2019 said Tom, describing his own\\r\\nfather\\u2019s house. \\u2018You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\\r\\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\\r\\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\\r\\nwish.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\\r\\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\\r\\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart\\u2019s content. As soon as\\r\\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\\r\\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\\r\\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. \\u2018Will you be easy?\\u2019 said the\\r\\nwolf; \\u2018you\\u2019ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018What\\u2019s that to me?\\u2019 said the little man; \\u2018you have had your frolic, now\\r\\nI\\u2019ve a mind to be merry myself\\u2019; and he began, singing and shouting as\\r\\nloud as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\\r\\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\\r\\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\\r\\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. \\u2018Do you stay behind,\\u2019 said the woodman,\\r\\n\\u2018and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\\r\\nscythe.\\u2019 Tom heard all this, and cried out, \\u2018Father, father! I am here,\\r\\nthe wolf has swallowed me.\\u2019 And his father said, \\u2018Heaven be praised! we\\r\\nhave found our dear child again\\u2019; and he told his wife not to use the\\r\\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\\r\\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\\r\\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the father,\\r\\n\\u2018what fears we have had for you!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, father,\\u2019 answered he; \\u2018I have\\r\\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\\r\\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Why, where have you been?\\u2019 said his father. \\u2018I have been in a\\r\\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow\\u2019s throat--and in the\\r\\nwolf\\u2019s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well,\\u2019 said they, \\u2018you are come back, and we will not sell you again\\r\\nfor all the riches in the world.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\\r\\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\\r\\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\\r\\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\\r\\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\\r\\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\\r\\nagreed that, after all, there\\u2019s no place like HOME!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\\r\\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller\\u2019s house was\\r\\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\\r\\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\\r\\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\\r\\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\\r\\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller\\u2019s boast\\r\\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\\r\\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\\r\\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, \\u2018All this must\\r\\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.\\u2019 It was in vain\\r\\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\\r\\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\\r\\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\\r\\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\\r\\nhobbled in, and said, \\u2018Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\\r\\nweeping for?\\u2019 \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I must spin this straw into gold, and\\r\\nI know not how.\\u2019 \\u2018What will you give me,\\u2019 said the hobgoblin, \\u2018to do it\\r\\nfor you?\\u2019 \\u2018My necklace,\\u2019 replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\\r\\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\\r\\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\\r\\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\\r\\nmiller\\u2019s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\\r\\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018What will you give me to do your task?\\u2019 \\u2018The ring on my finger,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\\r\\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\\r\\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller\\u2019s daughter to a yet\\r\\nlarger heap, and said, \\u2018All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\\r\\nyou shall be my queen.\\u2019 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018I have nothing left,\\u2019 said she. \\u2018Then say you will give me,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe little man, \\u2018the first little child that you may have when you are\\r\\nqueen.\\u2019 \\u2018That may never be,\\u2019 thought the miller\\u2019s daughter: and as she\\r\\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\\r\\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\\r\\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\\r\\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller\\u2019s\\r\\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\\r\\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\\r\\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\\r\\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\\r\\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\\r\\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, \\u2018I will give you three days\\u2019\\r\\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\\r\\nchild.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\\r\\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\\r\\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\\r\\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\\r\\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, \\u2018Madam, that is not my\\r\\nname.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\\r\\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\\r\\nstill said to every one of them, \\u2018Madam, that is not my name.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, \\u2018I have\\r\\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\\r\\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\\r\\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\\r\\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\\r\\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u201cMerrily the feast I\\u2019ll make.\\r\\n  Today I\\u2019ll brew, tomorrow bake;\\r\\n  Merrily I\\u2019ll dance and sing,\\r\\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\\r\\n  Little does my lady dream\\r\\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\\r\\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\\r\\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\\r\\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\\r\\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\\r\\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, \\u2018Now, lady, what is my\\r\\nname?\\u2019 \\u2018Is it JOHN?\\u2019 asked she. \\u2018No, madam!\\u2019 \\u2018Is it TOM?\\u2019 \\u2018No, madam!\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Is it JEMMY?\\u2019 \\u2018It is not.\\u2019 \\u2018Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?\\u2019 said the\\r\\nlady slyly. \\u2018Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!\\u2019 cried\\r\\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\\r\\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\\r\\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\\r\\ntrouble for nothing, and said, \\u2018We wish you a very good morning, and a\\r\\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\\r\\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\\r\\nwas quite happy and thought: \\u2018You certainly are a pretty girl!\\u2019 And when\\r\\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\\r\\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\\r\\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: \\u2018The cook must know what\\r\\nthe food is like.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: \\u2018Gretel, there is a\\r\\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\\u2019 \\u2018I will\\r\\nsee to it, master,\\u2019 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\\r\\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\\r\\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\\r\\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\\r\\nto her master: \\u2018If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\\r\\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\\r\\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.\\u2019 The master said: \\u2018I will run\\r\\nmyself, and fetch the guest.\\u2019 When the master had turned his back,\\r\\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \\u2018Standing\\r\\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\\r\\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\\r\\ndrink.\\u2019 She ran down, set a jug, said: \\u2018God bless it for you, Gretel,\\u2019\\r\\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\\r\\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\\r\\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\\r\\nGretel thought: \\u2018Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\\u2019\\r\\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: \\u2018Ah! how good fowls are! It\\r\\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\\r\\ntime!\\u2019 She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\\r\\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\\r\\n\\u2018One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.\\u2019\\r\\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\\r\\nthought: \\u2018The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\\r\\nsomething is missing.\\u2019 When the two wings were eaten, she went and\\r\\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\\r\\nher: \\u2018Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\\r\\nsomewhere.\\u2019 Then she said: \\u2018Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\\r\\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\\r\\neaten you will have some peace, why should God\\u2019s good gifts be spoilt?\\u2019\\r\\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\\r\\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\\r\\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\\r\\n\\u2018What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what\\u2019s\\r\\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\\r\\nanother draught it would do me no harm.\\u2019 So she took another hearty\\r\\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \\u2018Hurry\\r\\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, sir, I will\\r\\nsoon serve up,\\u2019 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\\r\\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\\r\\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\\r\\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\\r\\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\\r\\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: \\u2018Hush! hush! go away as quickly\\r\\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\\r\\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\\r\\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\\u2019 The guest\\r\\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\\r\\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\\r\\n\\u2018You have invited a fine guest!\\u2019 \\u2018Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\\r\\nthat?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018he has taken the chickens which I was just\\r\\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!\\u2019 \\u2018That\\u2019s a\\r\\nnice trick!\\u2019 said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. \\u2018If he had\\r\\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.\\u2019 He called to\\r\\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\\r\\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: \\u2018Just one, just one,\\u2019 meaning\\r\\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\\r\\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\\r\\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\\r\\nthem both with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\\r\\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\\r\\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\\r\\nout of his mouth. His son and his son\\u2019s wife were disgusted at this, so\\r\\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\\r\\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\\r\\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\\r\\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\\r\\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\\r\\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\\r\\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\\r\\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \\u2018What are\\r\\nyou doing there?\\u2019 asked the father. \\u2018I am making a little trough,\\u2019\\r\\nanswered the child, \\u2018for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\\r\\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\\r\\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\\r\\ndid spill a little of anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\\r\\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\\r\\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\\r\\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\\r\\n\\u2018Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\\r\\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\\r\\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.\\u2019 the woman\\r\\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\\r\\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\\r\\nhanging down as if it were eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\\r\\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: \\u2018Look, I have a little calf there,\\r\\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.\\u2019 The cow-herd said: \\u2018All\\r\\nright,\\u2019 and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\\r\\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\\r\\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: \\u2018It will soon run by itself,\\r\\njust look how it eats already!\\u2019 At night when he was going to drive the\\r\\nherd home again, he said to the calf: \\u2018If you can stand there and eat\\r\\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don\\u2019t care to drag you\\r\\nhome again in my arms.\\u2019 But the little peasant stood at his door, and\\r\\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\\r\\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\\r\\ncow-herd answered: \\u2018It is still standing out there eating. It would not\\r\\nstop and come with us.\\u2019 But the little peasant said: \\u2018Oh, but I must\\r\\nhave my beast back again.\\u2019 Then they went back to the meadow together,\\r\\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: \\u2018It\\r\\nmust have run away.\\u2019 The peasant, however, said: \\u2018Don\\u2019t tell me\\r\\nthat,\\u2019 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\\r\\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\\r\\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\\r\\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\\r\\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\\r\\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\\r\\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\\r\\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\\r\\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\\r\\nmiller\\u2019s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: \\u2018Lay\\r\\nyourself on the straw there,\\u2019 and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\\r\\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\\r\\nthought: \\u2018He is tired and has gone to sleep.\\u2019 In the meantime came the\\r\\nparson; the miller\\u2019s wife received him well, and said: \\u2018My husband is\\r\\nout, so we will have a feast.\\u2019 The peasant listened, and when he heard\\r\\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\\r\\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\\r\\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\\r\\noutside. The woman said: \\u2018Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\\u2019 she quickly\\r\\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\\r\\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\\r\\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: \\u2018Thank\\r\\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\\r\\nworld were coming to an end.\\u2019 The miller saw the peasant lying on the\\r\\nstraw, and asked, \\u2018What is that fellow doing there?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nwife, \\u2018the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\\r\\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\\r\\nthe straw was.\\u2019 The man said: \\u2018I have no objection, but be quick and get\\r\\nme something to eat.\\u2019 The woman said: \\u2018But I have nothing but bread and\\r\\ncheese.\\u2019 \\u2018I am contented with anything,\\u2019 replied the husband, \\u2018so far as\\r\\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\\u2019 and looked at the peasant and\\r\\nsaid: \\u2018Come and eat some more with me.\\u2019 The peasant did not require to\\r\\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\\r\\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: \\u2018What have you\\r\\nthere?\\u2019 The peasant answered: \\u2018I have a soothsayer inside it.\\u2019 \\u2018Can\\r\\nhe foretell anything to me?\\u2019 said the miller. \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 answered\\r\\nthe peasant: \\u2018but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\\r\\nhimself.\\u2019 The miller was curious, and said: \\u2018Let him foretell something\\r\\nfor once.\\u2019 Then the peasant pinched the raven\\u2019s head, so that he croaked\\r\\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \\u2018What did he say?\\u2019 The\\r\\npeasant answered: \\u2018In the first place, he says that there is some wine\\r\\nhidden under the pillow.\\u2019 \\u2018Bless me!\\u2019 cried the miller, and went there\\r\\nand found the wine. \\u2018Now go on,\\u2019 said he. The peasant made the raven\\r\\ncroak again, and said: \\u2018In the second place, he says that there is some\\r\\nroast meat in the tiled stove.\\u2019 \\u2018Upon my word!\\u2019 cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\\r\\nprophesy still more, and said: \\u2018Thirdly, he says that there is some\\r\\nsalad on the bed.\\u2019 \\u2018That would be a fine thing!\\u2019 cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\\r\\nonce more till he croaked, and said: \\u2018Fourthly, he says that there\\r\\nare some cakes under the bed.\\u2019 \\u2018That would be a fine thing!\\u2019 cried the\\r\\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\\u2019s wife\\r\\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\\r\\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\\r\\npeasant said: \\u2018First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\\r\\nis something bad.\\u2019 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\\r\\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\\r\\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\\u2019s\\r\\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \\u2018What did he say?\\u2019 The\\r\\npeasant replied: \\u2018He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\\r\\nthe closet on the porch.\\u2019 The miller said: \\u2018The Devil must go out,\\u2019 and\\r\\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\\r\\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\\r\\ncould, and the miller said: \\u2018It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\\r\\nown eyes.\\u2019 The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\\r\\nthe three hundred talers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\\r\\nhouse, and the peasants said: \\u2018The small peasant has certainly been to\\r\\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\\r\\nshovels.\\u2019 Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\\r\\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: \\u2018I sold my cow\\u2019s\\r\\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.\\u2019 When the peasants heard\\r\\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\\r\\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\\r\\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \\u2018But my\\r\\nservant must go first.\\u2019 When she came to the merchant in the town, he\\r\\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\\r\\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: \\u2018What can I do with all\\r\\nthese skins?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\\r\\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\\r\\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\\r\\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\\r\\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\\r\\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\\r\\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\\r\\nman who had been with the miller\\u2019s wife. He said to him: \\u2018I set you free\\r\\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.\\u2019 At this same moment up\\r\\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\\r\\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \\u2018No, I\\r\\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\\u2019 The\\r\\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \\u2018What are you about?\\r\\nWhat is it that you will not do?\\u2019 The peasant said: \\u2018They want to make\\r\\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\\u2019\\r\\nThe shepherd said: \\u2018If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\\r\\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.\\u2019 The peasant said: \\u2018If you\\r\\nwill get in, you will be mayor.\\u2019 The shepherd was willing, and got in,\\r\\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\\u2019s\\r\\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\\r\\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\\r\\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\\r\\ncried: \\u2018I am quite willing to be mayor.\\u2019 They believed no otherwise than\\r\\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: \\u2018That is\\r\\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\\r\\nthere,\\u2019 and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\\r\\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\\r\\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\\r\\nwater?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, truly,\\u2019 replied the peasant, \\u2018I sank deep, deep down,\\r\\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\\r\\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\\r\\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\\r\\nme.\\u2019 Said the peasants: \\u2018Are there any more there?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, yes,\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018more than I could want.\\u2019 Then the peasants made up their minds that\\r\\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\\r\\nmayor said: \\u2018I come first.\\u2019 So they went to the water together, and just\\r\\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\\r\\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\\r\\nthe peasants cried: \\u2018We already see the sheep down below!\\u2019 The mayor\\r\\npressed forward and said: \\u2018I will go down first, and look about me, and\\r\\nif things promise well I\\u2019ll call you.\\u2019 So he jumped in; splash! went\\r\\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\\r\\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\\r\\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\\r\\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\\r\\n\\u2018Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\\r\\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Very well,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018it shall all be ready.\\u2019 When dinner-time drew\\r\\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\\r\\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\\r\\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\\r\\nthen she said to herself, \\u2018The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\\r\\nto the cellar for the ale.\\u2019 So she left the pan on the fire and took a\\r\\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\\r\\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\\r\\nhead, \\u2018The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\\r\\nthat\\u2019s well thought of.\\u2019 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\\r\\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\\r\\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \\u2018It\\u2019s all gone, and \\u201cwhat\\r\\ncan\\u2019t be cured must be endured\\u201d,\\u2019 said Catherine. So she turned round;\\r\\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\\r\\nto cool herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\\r\\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\\r\\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\\r\\nhappened. \\u2018My stars!\\u2019 said she, \\u2018what shall I do to keep Frederick from\\r\\nseeing all this slopping about?\\u2019 So she thought a while; and at last\\r\\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\\r\\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\\r\\nnicely. \\u2018What a lucky thing,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018that we kept that meal! we have\\r\\nnow a good use for it.\\u2019 So away she went for it: but she managed to set\\r\\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\\r\\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \\u2018Ah!\\r\\nwell,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018when one goes another may as well follow.\\u2019 Then she\\r\\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\\r\\ncleverness, and said, \\u2018How very neat and clean it looks!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon Frederick came home. \\u2018Now, wife,\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018what have you for\\r\\ndinner?\\u2019 \\u2018O Frederick!\\u2019 answered she, \\u2018I was cooking you a steak; but\\r\\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\\r\\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\\r\\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\\r\\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!\\u2019 \\u2018Kate, Kate,\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018how could you do all this?\\u2019 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\\r\\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?\\u2019 \\u2018Why, Frederick,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I\\r\\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband thought to himself, \\u2018If my wife manages matters thus, I must\\r\\nlook sharp myself.\\u2019 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\\r\\nsaid to Catherine, \\u2018What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\\r\\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\\r\\nnever go near or meddle with them.\\u2019 \\u2018No, Frederick,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018that\\r\\nI never will.\\u2019 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\\r\\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\\r\\n\\u2018Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\\r\\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\\u2019 \\u2018Yellow\\r\\nbuttons!\\u2019 said they: \\u2018let us have a look at them.\\u2019 \\u2018Go into the garden\\r\\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\\r\\nnot go myself.\\u2019 So the rogues went: and when they found what these\\r\\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\\r\\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\\r\\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, \\u2018Kate, what have you been\\r\\ndoing?\\u2019 \\u2018See,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018I have bought all these with your yellow\\r\\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\\r\\nand dug them up.\\u2019 \\u2018Wife, wife,\\u2019 said Frederick, \\u2018what a pretty piece of\\r\\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\\r\\nto do such a thing?\\u2019 \\u2018Why,\\u2019 answered she, \\u2018I did not know there was any\\r\\nharm in it; you should have told me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\\r\\n\\u2018Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\\r\\nthe thieves.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, we will try,\\u2019 answered he; \\u2018but take some butter\\r\\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Very well,\\u2019 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\\r\\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. \\u2018It does not matter,\\u2019 thought\\r\\nshe: \\u2018when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\\r\\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\\r\\non each side as they passed. \\u2018Ah, see now,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018how they have\\r\\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\\u2019 So she\\r\\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\\r\\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\\r\\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\\r\\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\\r\\nhas younger legs than I have.\\u2019 Then she rolled the other cheese after\\r\\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\\r\\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\\r\\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\\r\\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \\u2018Where are the butter and cheese?\\u2019\\r\\nsaid he. \\u2018Oh!\\u2019 answered she, \\u2018I used the butter to grease those poor\\r\\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\\r\\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\\r\\nthe road together somewhere.\\u2019 \\u2018What a goose you are to do such silly\\r\\nthings!\\u2019 said the husband. \\u2018How can you say so?\\u2019 said she; \\u2018I am sure\\r\\nyou never told me not.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \\u2018Kate, I hope you\\r\\nlocked the door safe when you came away.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 answered she, \\u2018you did\\r\\nnot tell me.\\u2019 \\u2018Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid Frederick, \\u2018and bring with you something to eat.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\\r\\n\\u2018Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\\u2019t think he is very fond of\\r\\nbutter and cheese: I\\u2019ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\\r\\nfor I have often seen him take some.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\\r\\ntook off the hinges, and said, \\u2018Frederick told me to lock the door, but\\r\\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\\u2019 So she took\\r\\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\\r\\nout, \\u2018There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\\r\\ncarefully as you please.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas! alas!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018what a clever wife I\\r\\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\\r\\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\\r\\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Very well,\\u2019 answered she, \\u2018I\\u2019ll carry the door; but I\\u2019ll not carry the\\r\\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\\r\\nyou please, I\\u2019ll fasten them to the door.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\\r\\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\\r\\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\\r\\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\\r\\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\\r\\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\\r\\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\\r\\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\\r\\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\\r\\nthe head with them: but they only said, \\u2018It must be near morning, for\\r\\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\\r\\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\\r\\nsoftly, \\u2018Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018not\\r\\nnow, they will discover us.\\u2019 \\u2018I can\\u2019t help that: they must go.\\u2019 \\u2018Well,\\r\\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.\\u2019 Then away rattled\\r\\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \\u2018Bless me,\\r\\nit is hailing.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\\r\\nso she whispered to Frederick, \\u2018I must throw the vinegar down.\\u2019 \\u2018Pray\\r\\ndon\\u2019t,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018it will discover us.\\u2019 \\u2018I can\\u2019t help that,\\u2019 said\\r\\nshe, \\u2018go it must.\\u2019 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018What a heavy dew there is!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it popped into Catherine\\u2019s head that it was the door itself that\\r\\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \\u2018Frederick, I must throw\\r\\nthe door down soon.\\u2019 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\\r\\nwas sure it would betray them. \\u2018Here goes, however,\\u2019 said she: and down\\r\\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\\r\\nout \\u2018Murder!\\u2019 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\\r\\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\\r\\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\\r\\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\\r\\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\\r\\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\\r\\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\\r\\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. \\u2018Be quiet, my\\r\\nchild,\\u2019 said the old woman, \\u2018and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\\r\\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\\r\\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\\r\\npush her well to the front.\\u2019 It would have been all over with the poor\\r\\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\\r\\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\\r\\nhad come, the witch\\u2019s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\\r\\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\\r\\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\\r\\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\\r\\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\\r\\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child\\u2019s\\r\\nhead off.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\\r\\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\\r\\nto him: \\u2018Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\\r\\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\\r\\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\\u2019 \\u2018But,\\u2019 said Roland,\\r\\n\\u2018I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\\r\\nif she pursues us.\\u2019 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\\r\\ndead girl\\u2019s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\\r\\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\\r\\nhurried away with her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\\r\\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\\r\\ncried: \\u2018Where are you?\\u2019 \\u2018Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,\\u2019 answered\\r\\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\\r\\nstairs, and cried again: \\u2018Where are you?\\u2019 \\u2018Here in the kitchen, I am\\r\\nwarming myself,\\u2019 cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\\r\\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: \\u2018Where are you?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\r\\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,\\u2019 cried the third drop of blood. She went\\r\\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\\r\\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\\r\\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\\r\\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\\r\\nsweetheart Roland. \\u2018That shall not help you,\\u2019 cried she, \\u2018even if you\\r\\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.\\u2019 She put on her\\r\\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hour\\u2019s walk at every step,\\r\\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\\r\\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\\r\\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\\r\\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\\r\\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\\r\\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\\r\\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\\r\\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\\r\\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\\r\\ntowards them, and said to the musician: \\u2018Dear musician, may I pluck that\\r\\nbeautiful flower for myself?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, yes,\\u2019 he replied, \\u2018I will play to\\r\\nyou while you do it.\\u2019 As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\\r\\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\\r\\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\\r\\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\\r\\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\\r\\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\\r\\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: \\u2018Now I will go to my father and\\r\\narrange for the wedding.\\u2019 \\u2018Then in the meantime I will stay here and\\r\\nwait for you,\\u2019 said the girl, \\u2018and that no one may recognize me, I will\\r\\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.\\u2019 Then Roland went away, and the\\r\\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\\r\\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\\r\\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\\r\\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\\r\\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: \\u2018Someone will surely come\\r\\nthis way, and trample me down.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\\r\\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\\r\\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\\r\\nin the shepherd\\u2019s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\\r\\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\\r\\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\\r\\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\\r\\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\\r\\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\\r\\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\\r\\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\\r\\nwoman said: \\u2018There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\\r\\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\\r\\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\\r\\nbe stopped.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\\r\\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\\r\\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\\r\\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\\r\\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\\r\\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\\r\\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\\r\\nanswered: \\u2018No,\\u2019 for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\\r\\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland\\u2019s wedding was to be celebrated,\\r\\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\\r\\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\\r\\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\\r\\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\\r\\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\\r\\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\\r\\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland\\u2019s\\r\\nears, he sprang up and cried: \\u2018I know the voice, that is the true\\r\\nbride, I will have no other!\\u2019 Everything he had forgotten, and which had\\r\\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\\r\\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\\r\\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOWDROP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\\r\\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\\r\\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\\r\\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\\r\\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\\r\\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, \\u2018Would that my little\\r\\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\\r\\nblack as this ebony windowframe!\\u2019 And so the little girl really did grow\\r\\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\\r\\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\\r\\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\\r\\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\\r\\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\\r\\nherself in it, and say:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass had always answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\\r\\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\\r\\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\\r\\nas usual:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\\r\\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\\r\\none of her servants, and said, \\u2018Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\\r\\nthat I may never see her any more.\\u2019 Then the servant led her away; but\\r\\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.\\u2019 So he left her by\\r\\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\\r\\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\\r\\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\\r\\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\\r\\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\\r\\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\\r\\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\\r\\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\\r\\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\\r\\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\\r\\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\\r\\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\\r\\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\\r\\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\\r\\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\\r\\ndown and went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\\r\\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\\r\\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\\r\\nright. The first said, \\u2018Who has been sitting on my stool?\\u2019 The second,\\r\\n\\u2018Who has been eating off my plate?\\u2019 The third, \\u2018Who has been picking my\\r\\nbread?\\u2019 The fourth, \\u2018Who has been meddling with my spoon?\\u2019 The fifth,\\r\\n\\u2018Who has been handling my fork?\\u2019 The sixth, \\u2018Who has been cutting with\\r\\nmy knife?\\u2019 The seventh, \\u2018Who has been drinking my wine?\\u2019 Then the first\\r\\nlooked round and said, \\u2018Who has been lying on my bed?\\u2019 And the rest came\\r\\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\\r\\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\\r\\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\\r\\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, \\u2018Good heavens! what a lovely child\\r\\nshe is!\\u2019 And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\\r\\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\\r\\nin turn, till the night was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\\r\\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\\r\\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\\r\\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\\r\\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\\r\\nhome; and they warned her, and said, \\u2018The queen will soon find out where\\r\\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\\r\\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\\r\\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\\r\\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\\r\\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\\r\\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\\r\\nknocked at the door, and cried, \\u2018Fine wares to sell!\\u2019 Snowdrop looked\\r\\nout at the window, and said, \\u2018Good day, good woman! what have you to\\r\\nsell?\\u2019 \\u2018Good wares, fine wares,\\u2019 said she; \\u2018laces and bobbins of all\\r\\ncolours.\\u2019 \\u2018I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\\r\\nsort of body,\\u2019 thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\\r\\n\\u2018Bless me!\\u2019 said the old woman, \\u2018how badly your stays are laced! Let me\\r\\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.\\u2019 Snowdrop did not dream of\\r\\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\\r\\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop\\u2019s breath was\\r\\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. \\u2018There\\u2019s an end to all\\r\\nthy beauty,\\u2019 said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\\r\\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\\r\\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\\r\\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\\r\\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, \\u2018The\\r\\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\\r\\nin when we are away.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\\r\\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\\r\\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\\r\\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\\r\\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfs\\u2019 cottage, she knocked at the door, and\\r\\ncried, \\u2018Fine wares to sell!\\u2019 But Snowdrop said, \\u2018I dare not let anyone\\r\\nin.\\u2019 Then the queen said, \\u2018Only look at my beautiful combs!\\u2019 and gave\\r\\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\\r\\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\\r\\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. \\u2018There you may\\r\\nlie,\\u2019 said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\\r\\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\\r\\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\\r\\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\\r\\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\\r\\nanyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\\r\\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, \\u2018Snowdrop shall die,\\r\\nif it cost me my life.\\u2019 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\\r\\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\\r\\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\\r\\npeasant\\u2019s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\\u2019 cottage,\\r\\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.\\u2019 \\u2018Do\\r\\nas you please,\\u2019 said the old woman, \\u2018but at any rate take this pretty\\r\\napple; I will give it you.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said Snowdrop, \\u2018I dare not take it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018You silly girl!\\u2019 answered the other, \\u2018what are you afraid of? Do you\\r\\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\\r\\nother.\\u2019 Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\\r\\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\\r\\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\\r\\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\\r\\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. \\u2018This time nothing will save\\r\\nthee,\\u2019 said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\\r\\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\\r\\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\\r\\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\\r\\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\\r\\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\\r\\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\\r\\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, \\u2018We will never bury her in\\r\\nthe cold ground.\\u2019 And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\\r\\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\\r\\nwas, and that she was a king\\u2019s daughter. And the coffin was set among\\r\\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\\r\\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\\r\\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\\r\\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\\r\\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\\r\\ndwarfs\\u2019 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\\r\\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\\r\\nto let him take her away; but they said, \\u2018We will not part with her for\\r\\nall the gold in the world.\\u2019 At last, however, they had pity on him, and\\r\\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\\r\\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\\r\\nawoke, and said, \\u2018Where am I?\\u2019 And the prince said, \\u2018Thou art quite safe\\r\\nwith me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, \\u2018I love you far better\\r\\nthan all the world; so come with me to my father\\u2019s palace, and you shall\\r\\nbe my wife.\\u2019 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\\r\\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\\r\\nwedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop\\u2019s old enemy the queen;\\r\\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\\r\\nglass and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\\r\\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\\r\\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\\r\\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\\r\\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\\r\\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\\r\\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\\r\\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\\r\\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PINK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\\r\\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\\r\\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\\r\\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\\r\\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\\r\\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\\r\\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\\r\\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\\r\\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\\r\\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen\\u2019s apron\\r\\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\\r\\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\\r\\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\\r\\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\\r\\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\\r\\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\\r\\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\\r\\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\\r\\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\\r\\nfood until the seven years were over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: \\u2018If the child has the power of\\r\\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\\u2019 So\\r\\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\\r\\nspeak, and said to him: \\u2018Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\\r\\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.\\u2019 Scarcely were the words out\\r\\nof the boy\\u2019s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\\r\\nAfter a while the cook said to him: \\u2018It is not well for you to be so\\r\\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.\\u2019 Then the king\\u2019s son\\r\\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\\r\\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\\r\\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\\r\\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\\r\\nthat the king\\u2019s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\\r\\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\\r\\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\\r\\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.\\u2019 Thereupon he went away, and when\\r\\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: \\u2018Why should I shed\\r\\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?\\u2019 The cook once\\r\\nmore said: \\u2018If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.\\u2019 When\\r\\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\\r\\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\\r\\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: \\u2018Lie down in\\r\\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.\\u2019 Then the wicked wretch came in\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Where are the boy\\u2019s heart and tongue?\\u2019 The girl reached the\\r\\nplate to him, but the king\\u2019s son threw off the quilt, and said: \\u2018You old\\r\\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\\r\\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\\r\\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\\r\\nthroat.\\u2019 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\\r\\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\\r\\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\\r\\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king\\u2019s son remained there a\\r\\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\\r\\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: \\u2018I will go home to my\\r\\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019\\r\\nshe replied, \\u2018the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\\r\\nwhere I am unknown?\\u2019 As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\\r\\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\\r\\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\\r\\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\\r\\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\\r\\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\\r\\nlooked inside, and cried: \\u2018Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\\r\\nalive, or are you dead?\\u2019 She answered: \\u2018I have just eaten, and am still\\r\\nsatisfied,\\u2019 for she thought the angels were there. Said he: \\u2018I am your\\r\\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\\r\\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.\\u2019 Then he descended\\r\\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\\r\\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\\r\\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\\r\\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\\r\\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\\r\\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\\r\\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\\r\\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\\r\\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\\r\\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\\r\\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\\r\\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\\r\\nhad none at all for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\\r\\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\\r\\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \\u2018As you are\\r\\nso clever, you shall sit by me.\\u2019 He replied: \\u2018Lord King, your majesty\\r\\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\\u2019 But the king insisted on it,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018You shall sit by me,\\u2019 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\\r\\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\\r\\nking\\u2019s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\\r\\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\\r\\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\\r\\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?\\u2019 But the king\\r\\nreplied: \\u2018She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\\r\\nnot have her named.\\u2019 Then the huntsman arose and said: \\u2018Gracious lord\\r\\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\\r\\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\\r\\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\\r\\nchicken.\\u2019 Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\\r\\n\\u2018That is the wretch!\\u2019 and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\\r\\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\\r\\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\\r\\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\\r\\nof the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\\r\\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\\r\\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\\r\\nspoke further and said: \\u2018Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\\r\\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\\r\\nthough her own life depended on it?\\u2019 The king replied: \\u2018Yes, I would\\r\\nlike to see her.\\u2019 The son said: \\u2018Most gracious father, I will show her\\r\\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,\\u2019 and he thrust his hand into\\r\\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\\r\\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\\r\\nThen the son said: \\u2018Now will I show her to you in her own form,\\u2019 and\\r\\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\\r\\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\\r\\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\\r\\nled in she ate nothing, and said: \\u2018The gracious and merciful God who has\\r\\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.\\u2019 She lived three days\\r\\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\\r\\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\\r\\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\\r\\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\\r\\nking\\u2019s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\\r\\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\\r\\nare still alive or not, is known to God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER ELSIE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\\r\\nwhen she had grown up her father said: \\u2018We will get her married.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the mother, \\u2018if only someone would come who would have her.\\u2019 At\\r\\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\\r\\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \\u2018Oh,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe father, \\u2018she has plenty of good sense\\u2019; and the mother said: \\u2018Oh,\\r\\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Well,\\u2019 said Hans, \\u2018if she is not really smart, I won\\u2019t have her.\\u2019 When\\r\\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: \\u2018Elsie, go\\r\\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.\\u2019 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\\r\\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\\r\\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\\r\\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\\r\\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\\r\\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\\r\\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\\r\\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\\r\\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: \\u2018If I get Hans, and we have\\r\\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\\r\\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\\u2019 Then she\\r\\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\\r\\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\\r\\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\\r\\n\\u2018Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.\\u2019 The maid went and\\r\\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. \\u2018Elsie why\\r\\ndo you weep?\\u2019 asked the maid. \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 she answered, \\u2018have I not reason to\\r\\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\\r\\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\\r\\nhim.\\u2019 Then said the maid: \\u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\\u2019 and sat down\\r\\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\\r\\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\\r\\nbeer, the man said to the boy: \\u2018Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.\\u2019 The boy went down, and there sat Clever\\r\\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: \\u2018Why are you\\r\\nweeping?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 said Elsie, \\u2018have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\\r\\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\\r\\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\\u2019 Then said the boy: \\u2018What\\r\\na clever Elsie we have!\\u2019 and sat down by her, and likewise began to\\r\\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\\r\\nreturn, the man said to the woman: \\u2018Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie is!\\u2019 The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\\r\\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\\r\\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\\r\\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\\r\\nmother likewise: \\u2018What a clever Elsie we have!\\u2019 and sat down and wept\\r\\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\\r\\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: \\u2018I must go into the\\r\\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.\\u2019 But when he got into the cellar,\\r\\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\\r\\nthat Elsie\\u2019s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\\r\\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\\r\\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\\r\\ntime when it fell down, he cried: \\u2018Oh, what a clever Elsie!\\u2019 and sat\\r\\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\\r\\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: \\u2018They must be\\r\\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.\\u2019\\r\\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\\r\\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. \\u2018What misfortune has happened\\r\\nthen?\\u2019 asked he. \\u2018Ah, dear Hans,\\u2019 said Elsie, \\u2018if we marry each other\\r\\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\\r\\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\\r\\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\\r\\nweep?\\u2019 \\u2018Come,\\u2019 said Hans, \\u2018more understanding than that is not needed\\r\\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,\\u2019 and\\r\\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: \\u2018Wife, I am going out to work\\r\\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\\r\\nmay have some bread.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.\\u2019 After Hans had\\r\\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\\r\\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: \\u2018What shall I\\r\\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\\r\\nmore said: \\u2018What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\\r\\nI will sleep first.\\u2019 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\\r\\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\\r\\nhe: \\u2018What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\\r\\neven come home to eat.\\u2019 But when evening came and she still stayed away,\\r\\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\\r\\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\\r\\na fowler\\u2019s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\\r\\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\\r\\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\\r\\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\\r\\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\\r\\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\\r\\nnot, and said: \\u2018Is it I, or is it not I?\\u2019 But she knew not what answer\\r\\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\\r\\n\\u2018I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\\r\\nto know.\\u2019 She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\\r\\nshe knocked at the window and cried: \\u2018Hans, is Elsie within?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019\\r\\nanswered Hans, \\u2018she is within.\\u2019 Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\\r\\n\\u2018Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,\\u2019 and went to another door; but when the\\r\\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\\r\\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\\r\\nseen her since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\\r\\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\\r\\ninto the man\\u2019s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\\r\\nso he went to his master, and said, \\u2018I have worked hard for you a long\\r\\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\\r\\ntrouble.\\u2019 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\\r\\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\\u2019s\\r\\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\\r\\nhave, and said to himself, \\u2018Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\\r\\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\\r\\nmerry.\\u2019 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\\r\\nover hill and valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\\r\\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. \\u2018Why, what should make\\r\\nme down-hearted?\\u2019 said he; \\u2018I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\\r\\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three years\\u2019 earnings and have it\\r\\nall safe in my pocket.\\u2019 \\u2018How much may it come to?\\u2019 said the little man.\\r\\n\\u2018Full threepence,\\u2019 replied the countryman. \\u2018I wish you would give them\\r\\nto me,\\u2019 said the other; \\u2018I am very poor.\\u2019 Then the man pitied him, and\\r\\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \\u2018As you have\\r\\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\\r\\npenny; so choose whatever you like.\\u2019 Then the countryman rejoiced at\\r\\nhis good luck, and said, \\u2018I like many things better than money: first, I\\r\\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\\r\\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\\r\\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\\u2019 The dwarf\\r\\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\\r\\nand went his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\\r\\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\\r\\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\\r\\nsinging away most joyfully. \\u2018Oh, what a pretty bird!\\u2019 said the miser; \\u2018I\\r\\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.\\u2019 \\u2018If that\\u2019s all,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the countryman, \\u2018I will soon bring it down.\\u2019 Then he took up his\\r\\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\\r\\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\\r\\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\\r\\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\\r\\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\\r\\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\\r\\nthe blood ran down. \\u2018Oh, for heaven\\u2019s sake!\\u2019 cried the miser, \\u2018Master!\\r\\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,\\u2019 said the other; \\u2018thou\\r\\nart only meeting thy reward\\u2019: so he played up another tune. Then the\\r\\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\\r\\nhe did not come up to the musician\\u2019s price for some time, and he danced\\r\\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\\r\\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\\r\\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\\r\\nsaw so much money, he said, \\u2018I will agree to your proposal.\\u2019 So he took\\r\\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\\r\\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\\r\\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\\r\\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\\r\\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\\r\\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\\r\\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\\r\\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\\r\\nhis money. \\u2018No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\\u2019 said the\\r\\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\\r\\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \\u2018My Lord\\r\\nJudge, grant me one last request.\\u2019 \\u2018Anything but thy life,\\u2019 replied the\\r\\nother. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\\r\\nmy fiddle for the last time.\\u2019 The miser cried out, \\u2018Oh, no! no! for\\r\\nheaven\\u2019s sake don\\u2019t listen to him! don\\u2019t listen to him!\\u2019 But the judge\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018It is only this once, he will soon have done.\\u2019 The fact was, he\\r\\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\\u2019s third gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the miser said, \\u2018Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\\u2019s sake.\\u2019 But\\r\\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\\r\\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\\r\\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\\r\\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\\r\\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\\r\\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\\r\\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\\r\\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\\r\\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\\r\\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\\r\\nthe hundred florins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called to the miser, and said, \\u2018Tell us now, you vagabond, where\\r\\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\\u2019 \\u2018I stole\\r\\nit,\\u2019 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \\u2018I acknowledge\\r\\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\\u2019 Then the countryman\\r\\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASHPUTTEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\\r\\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, \\u2018Always be\\r\\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\\u2019 Soon\\r\\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\\r\\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\\r\\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\\r\\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\\r\\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\\r\\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\\r\\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\\r\\nfor the poor little girl. \\u2018What does the good-for-nothing want in the\\r\\nparlour?\\u2019 said they; \\u2018they who would eat bread should first earn it;\\r\\naway with the kitchen-maid!\\u2019 Then they took away her fine clothes, and\\r\\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\\r\\ninto the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\\r\\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\\r\\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\\r\\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\\r\\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\\r\\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\\r\\nwife\\u2019s daughters what he should bring them. \\u2018Fine clothes,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nfirst; \\u2018Pearls and diamonds,\\u2019 cried the second. \\u2018Now, child,\\u2019 said he\\r\\nto his own daughter, \\u2018what will you have?\\u2019 \\u2018The first twig, dear\\r\\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\\r\\nhomewards,\\u2019 said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\\r\\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\\r\\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\\r\\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\\r\\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\\r\\nher mother\\u2019s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\\r\\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\\r\\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\\r\\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\\r\\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\\r\\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\\r\\na bride for himself. Ashputtel\\u2019s two sisters were asked to come; so they\\r\\ncalled her up, and said, \\u2018Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\\r\\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king\\u2019s feast.\\u2019\\r\\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\\r\\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\\r\\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\\r\\nto let her go. \\u2018You, Ashputtel!\\u2019 said she; \\u2018you who have nothing to\\r\\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\\r\\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\\r\\nher, \\u2018I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\\r\\ntwo hours\\u2019 time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\\r\\ntoo.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\\r\\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\\r\\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\\r\\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\\r\\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\\r\\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\\r\\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\\r\\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\\r\\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\\r\\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, \\u2018No, no! you\\r\\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.\\u2019 And when\\r\\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, \\u2018If you can in one hour\\u2019s\\r\\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\\r\\ntoo.\\u2019 And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\\r\\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\\r\\nand cried out as before:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\\r\\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\\r\\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\\r\\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\\r\\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\\r\\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour\\u2019s time all\\r\\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\\r\\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\\r\\nBut her mother said, \\u2018It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\\r\\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame\\u2019: and off\\r\\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\\r\\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\\r\\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\\r\\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\\r\\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\\r\\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\\r\\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king\\u2019s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\\r\\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\\r\\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, \\u2018This lady is dancing with me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\\r\\ngo home: and the king\\u2019s son said, \\u2018I shall go and take care of you to\\r\\nyour home\\u2019; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\\r\\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\\r\\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\\r\\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\\r\\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\\r\\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\\r\\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\\r\\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\\r\\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\\r\\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\\r\\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\\r\\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\\r\\nlittle grey frock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\\r\\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\\r\\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\\r\\nwondered at her beauty: but the king\\u2019s son, who was waiting for her,\\r\\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said as before, \\u2018This lady is dancing with me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\\u2019s son followed here\\r\\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\\r\\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her father\\u2019s house.\\r\\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\\r\\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\\r\\nbeing seen. Then the king\\u2019s son lost sight of her, and could not find\\r\\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\\r\\nto him, \\u2018The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\\r\\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.\\u2019 The father thought to\\r\\nhimself, \\u2018Can it be Ashputtel?\\u2019 So he had an axe brought; and they cut\\r\\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\\r\\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\\r\\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\\r\\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\\r\\nfrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\\r\\nwent again into the garden, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\\r\\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\\r\\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\\r\\nking\\u2019s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said, \\u2018This lady is _my_ partner, sir.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\\u2019s son would go with\\r\\nher, and said to himself, \\u2018I will not lose her this time\\u2019; but, however,\\r\\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\\r\\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\\r\\nand said, \\u2018I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\\r\\nfits.\\u2019 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\\r\\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\\r\\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\\r\\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\\r\\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\\r\\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, \\u2018Never mind, cut it off; when you\\r\\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.\\u2019 So\\r\\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\\r\\nand went to the king\\u2019s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\\r\\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\\r\\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For she\\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\\r\\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\\r\\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\\r\\nand said, \\u2018This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\\r\\non the slipper.\\u2019 Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\\r\\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\\r\\nin till the blood came, and took her to the king\\u2019s son: and he set her\\r\\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\\r\\nand sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For she\\u2019s not the true one that sits by thy side.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\\r\\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\\r\\nand brought her also back again. \\u2018This is not the true bride,\\u2019 said he\\r\\nto the father; \\u2018have you no other daughters?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said he; \\u2018there is\\r\\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\\r\\nsure she cannot be the bride.\\u2019 The prince told him to send her. But the\\r\\nmother said, \\u2018No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\\r\\nherself.\\u2019 However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\\r\\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\\r\\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\\r\\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\\r\\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018This is the right bride.\\u2019 But the mother and both the sisters\\r\\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\\r\\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\\r\\nwhite dove sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Home! home! look at the shoe!\\r\\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\\r\\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\\r\\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\\r\\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\\r\\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\\r\\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\\r\\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\\r\\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\\r\\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\\r\\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\\r\\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\\r\\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\\r\\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\\r\\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\\r\\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\\r\\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\\r\\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\\r\\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\\r\\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\\r\\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\\r\\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\\r\\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\\r\\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\\r\\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\\r\\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\\r\\ndismissed with no better answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\\r\\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\\r\\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\\r\\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\\r\\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\\r\\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\\r\\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\\r\\none said in a pitiful tone: \\u2018Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\\r\\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\\u2019s\\r\\nwindow.\\u2019 The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\\r\\nkitchen, and said to the cook: \\u2018Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \\u2018she has spared\\r\\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\\r\\nenough.\\u2019 So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\\r\\nspit, the queen\\u2019s ring was found inside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\\r\\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\\r\\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\\r\\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\\r\\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\\r\\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\\r\\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\\r\\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\\r\\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\\r\\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\\r\\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: \\u2018We will remember you\\r\\nand repay you for saving us!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\\r\\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: \\u2018Why\\r\\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\\r\\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\\r\\nmercy!\\u2019 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\\r\\nhim: \\u2018We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\\r\\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. \\u2018Out with you, you\\r\\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!\\u2019 cried they; \\u2018we cannot find food for\\r\\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.\\u2019\\r\\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\\r\\ncrying: \\u2018Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\\r\\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?\\u2019 So the\\r\\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\\r\\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\\r\\nhunger, and cried: \\u2018We will remember you--one good turn deserves\\r\\nanother!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\\r\\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\\r\\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \\u2018The king\\u2019s\\r\\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\\r\\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\\u2019 Many had\\r\\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\\r\\nsaw the king\\u2019s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\\r\\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\\r\\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\\r\\nbottom of the sea, and added: \\u2018If you come up again without it you will\\r\\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\\u2019 All the\\r\\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\\r\\nalone by the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\\r\\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\\r\\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\\r\\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\\u2019s feet, and when he\\r\\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\\r\\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\\r\\nthe promised reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\\r\\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\\r\\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\\r\\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: \\u2018Tomorrow morning\\r\\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\\r\\nwanting.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\\r\\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\\r\\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\\r\\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\\r\\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\\r\\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\\r\\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\\r\\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the king\\u2019s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\\r\\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\\r\\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: \\u2018Although he\\r\\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\\r\\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.\\u2019 The youth did not know where\\r\\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\\r\\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\\r\\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\\r\\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\\r\\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\\r\\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\\r\\nsaid: \\u2018We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\\r\\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\\r\\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\\r\\nstands, and have brought you the apple.\\u2019 The youth, full of joy, set out\\r\\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king\\u2019s beautiful daughter,\\r\\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\\r\\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\\r\\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\\r\\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\\r\\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\\r\\nseven to her and said: \\u2018Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\\r\\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\\r\\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\\r\\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\\u2019 The\\r\\nkids said: \\u2018Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\\r\\naway without any anxiety.\\u2019 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\\r\\nwith an easy mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\\r\\n\\u2018Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\\r\\nsomething back with her for each of you.\\u2019 But the little kids knew that\\r\\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. \\u2018We will not open the door,\\u2019 cried\\r\\nthey, \\u2018you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\\r\\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!\\u2019 Then the wolf went away to a\\r\\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\\r\\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\\r\\nhouse, and called: \\u2018Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\\r\\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.\\u2019 But the wolf\\r\\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\\r\\nand cried: \\u2018We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\\r\\nlike you: you are the wolf!\\u2019 Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: \\u2018I\\r\\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.\\u2019 And when the baker\\r\\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: \\u2018Strew some\\r\\nwhite meal over my feet for me.\\u2019 The miller thought to himself: \\u2018The\\r\\nwolf wants to deceive someone,\\u2019 and refused; but the wolf said: \\u2018If you\\r\\nwill not do it, I will devour you.\\u2019 Then the miller was afraid, and made\\r\\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\\r\\nit and said: \\u2018Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\\r\\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\\r\\nforest with her.\\u2019 The little kids cried: \\u2018First show us your paws that\\r\\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.\\u2019 Then he put his paws\\r\\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\\r\\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\\r\\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\\r\\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\\r\\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\\r\\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\\r\\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\\r\\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\\r\\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\\r\\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\\r\\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\\r\\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\\r\\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\\r\\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\\r\\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\\r\\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\\r\\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\\r\\ncried: \\u2018Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.\\u2019 She took the kid out, and\\r\\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\\r\\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\\r\\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\\r\\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\\r\\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. \\u2018Ah,\\r\\nheavens,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018is it possible that my poor children whom he has\\r\\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?\\u2019 Then the kid had to\\r\\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\\r\\nopen the monster\\u2019s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\\r\\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\\r\\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\\r\\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\\r\\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\\r\\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: \\u2018Now\\r\\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast\\u2019s\\r\\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.\\u2019 Then the seven kids dragged\\r\\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\\r\\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\\r\\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\\r\\nstirred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\\r\\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\\r\\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\\r\\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\\r\\nhe:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018What rumbles and tumbles\\r\\n  Against my poor bones?\\r\\n  I thought \\u2018twas six kids,\\r\\n  But it feels like big stones.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\\r\\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\\r\\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: \\u2018The wolf\\r\\nis dead! The wolf is dead!\\u2019 and danced for joy round about the well with\\r\\ntheir mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE QUEEN BEE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo kings\\u2019 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\\r\\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\\r\\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\\r\\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\\r\\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\\r\\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\\r\\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\\r\\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\\r\\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\\r\\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\\r\\nlittle dwarf said, \\u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\\r\\nsuffer you to trouble them.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\\r\\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\\r\\ndwarf said, \\u2018Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\\r\\nthem.\\u2019 Next they came to a bees\\u2019-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\\r\\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\\r\\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\\r\\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, \\u2018Let the pretty insects enjoy\\r\\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\\r\\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\\r\\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\\r\\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\\r\\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\\r\\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\\r\\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\\r\\nhe rose and came out to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\\r\\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\\r\\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\\r\\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\\r\\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: \\u2018In the\\r\\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king\\u2019s\\r\\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\\r\\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\\r\\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\\r\\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\\r\\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\\r\\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last came the little dwarf\\u2019s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\\r\\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\\r\\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\\r\\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\\r\\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\\r\\nheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tablet said: \\u2018The key of the princess\\u2019s bed-chamber must be\\r\\nfished up out of the lake.\\u2019 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\\r\\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\\r\\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\\r\\nthe best of the king\\u2019s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\\r\\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\\r\\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\\r\\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\\r\\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\\r\\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\\r\\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\\r\\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\\r\\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\\r\\nher father\\u2019s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\\r\\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\\r\\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\\r\\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\\r\\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\\r\\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\\r\\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\\r\\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\\r\\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\\r\\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\\r\\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\\r\\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\\r\\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\\r\\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\\r\\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\\r\\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\\r\\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\\r\\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\\r\\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\\r\\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\\r\\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\\r\\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, \\u2018I should like to sit up and\\r\\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\\r\\nme.\\u2019 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\\r\\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\\r\\nthere, and watched what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\\r\\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker\\u2019s bench, took up all the work\\r\\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\\r\\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\\r\\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\\r\\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\\r\\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\\r\\nlightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. \\u2018These little wights have\\r\\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\\r\\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\\r\\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\\r\\nkeep off the cold. I\\u2019ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\\r\\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\\r\\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\\r\\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\\r\\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\\r\\nwatch what the little elves would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\\r\\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\\r\\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\\r\\nmightily delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\\r\\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\\r\\nout at the door, and away over the green.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\\r\\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\\r\\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\\r\\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\\r\\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\\r\\nremained childless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\\r\\nOne winter\\u2019s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\\r\\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\\r\\nsnow. \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 sighed the woman heavily, \\u2018if I had but a child, as red as\\r\\nblood and as white as snow,\\u2019 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\\r\\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\\r\\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\\r\\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\\r\\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\\r\\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\\r\\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\\r\\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\\r\\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\\r\\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\\r\\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\\r\\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\\r\\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. \\u2018If I\\r\\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.\\u2019 Then she felt comforted and happy\\r\\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\\r\\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\\r\\nwas so great that she died.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\\r\\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\\r\\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\\r\\non he married again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\\r\\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\\r\\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\\r\\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\\r\\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\\r\\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\\r\\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\\r\\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\\r\\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\\r\\nschool to the time he went back.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\\r\\nstore-room, and said, \\u2018Mother, give me an apple.\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, my child,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\\r\\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Mother,\\u2019 said the little daughter again, \\u2018may not brother have one\\r\\ntoo?\\u2019 The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \\u2018Yes, when he\\r\\ncomes out of school.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\\r\\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\\r\\nof her little daughter\\u2019s hand, and said, \\u2018You shall not have one before\\r\\nyour brother.\\u2019 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\\r\\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\\r\\nkindly to him, \\u2018My son, will you have an apple?\\u2019 but she gave him a\\r\\nwicked look. \\u2018Mother,\\u2019 said the boy, \\u2018how dreadful you look! Yes, give\\r\\nme an apple.\\u2019 The thought came to her that she would kill him. \\u2018Come\\r\\nwith me,\\u2019 she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \\u2018take one\\r\\nout for yourself.\\u2019 And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\\r\\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy\\u2019s head.\\r\\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\\r\\n\\u2018If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,\\u2019 she thought. So\\r\\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\\r\\nher top drawer; then she set the boy\\u2019s head again on his shoulders, and\\r\\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\\r\\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\\r\\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \\u2018Mother, brother is\\r\\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\\r\\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\\r\\nfrightened me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Go to him again,\\u2019 said her mother, \\u2018and if he does not answer, give him\\r\\na box on the ear.\\u2019 So little Marleen went, and said, \\u2018Brother, give me\\r\\nthat apple,\\u2019 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\\r\\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\\r\\ncrying and screaming to her mother. \\u2018Oh!\\u2019 she said, \\u2018I have knocked off\\r\\nbrother\\u2019s head,\\u2019 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What have you done!\\u2019 said her mother, \\u2018but no one must know about it,\\r\\nso you must keep silence; what is done can\\u2019t be undone; we will make\\r\\nhim into puddings.\\u2019 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\\r\\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\\r\\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\\r\\nneed of salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\\r\\n\\u2018Where is my son?\\u2019 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\\r\\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father again asked, \\u2018Where is my son?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Oh,\\u2019 answered the wife, \\u2018he is gone into the country to his mother\\u2019s\\r\\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\\r\\nweeks; he is well looked after there.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I feel very unhappy about it,\\u2019 said the husband, \\u2018in case it should not\\r\\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, \\u2018Little Marleen, why do\\r\\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.\\u2019 Then he asked his wife for more\\r\\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\\r\\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\\r\\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\\r\\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\\r\\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\\r\\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\\r\\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\\r\\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\\r\\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\\r\\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\\r\\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\\r\\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\\r\\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\\r\\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\\r\\nthe table and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\\r\\nsing:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\\r\\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\\r\\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\\r\\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\\r\\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\\r\\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\\r\\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Bird,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Nay,\\u2019 said the bird, \\u2018I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\\r\\nchain, and I will sing it you again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Here is the chain, take it,\\u2019 said the goldsmith. \\u2018Only sing me that\\r\\nagain.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\\r\\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker\\u2019s house and\\r\\nsang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\\r\\nshirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\\r\\nhand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Bird,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018how beautifully you sing!\\u2019 Then he called through the\\r\\ndoor to his wife: \\u2018Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\\r\\nand hear how beautifully it sings.\\u2019 Then he called his daughter and the\\r\\nchildren, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\\r\\nstreet to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\\r\\nand green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\\r\\nbright stars in its head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Bird,\\u2019 said the shoemaker, \\u2018sing me that song again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Nay,\\u2019 answered the bird, \\u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\\r\\ngive me something.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Wife,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\\r\\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.\\u2019 The wife went in and fetched\\r\\nthe shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018There, bird,\\u2019 said the shoemaker, \\u2018now sing me that song again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\\r\\nwent back to the roof and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\\r\\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\\r\\nmill went \\u2018Click clack, click clack, click clack.\\u2019 Inside the mill were\\r\\ntwenty of the miller\\u2019s men hewing a stone, and as they went \\u2018Hick hack,\\r\\nhick hack, hick hack,\\u2019 the mill went \\u2018Click clack, click clack, click\\r\\nclack.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen one of the men left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo more men left off and listened,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen four more left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nnow there were only eight at work,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only five,\\r\\n\\r\\n  the juniper-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only one,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Bird,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\\r\\ntoo; sing it again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Nay,\\u2019 answered the bird, \\u2018I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\\r\\nmillstone, and I will sing it again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018If it belonged to me alone,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018you should have it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Yes, yes,\\u2019 said the others: \\u2018if he will sing again, he can have it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\\r\\nstone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\\r\\nthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\\r\\ntree and sang--\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\\r\\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\\r\\nhis neck, he flew right away to his father\\u2019s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018How lighthearted I feel,\\u2019 said the father, \\u2018so pleased and cheerful.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018And I,\\u2019 said the mother, \\u2018I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\\r\\nwere coming.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I do feel so happy,\\u2019 said the father, \\u2018and how beautifully the sun\\r\\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Ah!\\u2019 said the wife, \\u2018and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\\r\\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,\\u2019 and\\r\\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\\r\\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\\r\\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\\r\\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Look, mother,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018at the beautiful bird that is singing so\\r\\nmagnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\\r\\nscent of spice in the air!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018I must go outside and see the bird nearer,\\u2019 said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Ah, do not go!\\u2019 cried the wife. \\u2018I feel as if the whole house were in\\r\\nflames!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\\r\\nman\\u2019s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went inside, and said, \\u2018See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\\r\\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\\r\\nand her cap fell from her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Ah me!\\u2019 cried the wife, \\u2018if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\\r\\nearth, that I might not hear that song.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well,\\u2019 said little Marleen, \\u2018I will go out too and see if the bird will\\r\\ngive me anything.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\\r\\ndanced and jumped about in them. \\u2018I was so miserable,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018when I\\r\\ncame out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\\r\\nand he has given me a pair of red shoes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\\r\\nof fire. \\u2018Then I will go out too,\\u2019 she said, \\u2018and see if it will lighten\\r\\nmy misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\\r\\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\\r\\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\\r\\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\\r\\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\\r\\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TURNIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\\r\\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\\r\\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\\r\\nand sowed turnips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\\r\\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\\r\\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\\r\\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\\r\\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\\r\\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\\r\\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, \\u2018What\\r\\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\\r\\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\\r\\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\\r\\nto the king. \\u2018What a wonderful thing!\\u2019 said the king; \\u2018I have seen many\\r\\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\\r\\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\\r\\nof fortune.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah, no!\\u2019 answered the gardener, \\u2018I am no child of fortune;\\r\\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\\r\\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\\r\\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\\r\\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, \\u2018You shall be poor no\\r\\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\\r\\nbrother.\\u2019 Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\\r\\nrich that his brother\\u2019s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\\r\\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\\r\\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\\r\\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\\r\\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\\r\\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\\r\\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\\r\\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\\r\\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\\r\\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\\r\\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\\r\\nkill his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\\r\\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \\u2018Dear brother, I have\\r\\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\\r\\nus.\\u2019 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\\r\\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\\r\\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\\r\\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\\r\\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\\r\\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\\r\\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\\r\\nhis head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\\r\\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\\r\\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, \\u2018Good\\r\\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!\\u2019 The student looked about\\r\\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\\r\\nfrom, cried out, \\u2018Who calls me?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man in the tree answered, \\u2018Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\\r\\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\\r\\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\\r\\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\\r\\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\\r\\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\\r\\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\\r\\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\\r\\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\\r\\nand own the power of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\\r\\n\\u2018Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\\r\\nlet me into the sack for a little while?\\u2019 Then the other answered, as if\\r\\nvery unwillingly, \\u2018A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\\r\\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\\r\\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\\r\\nto me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\\r\\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\\r\\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\\r\\nway, and said, \\u2018Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\\r\\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\\u2019 So the student let him down,\\r\\nopened the sack, and set him free. \\u2018Now then,\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018let me ascend\\r\\nquickly.\\u2019 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \\u2018Wait a\\r\\nwhile,\\u2019 said the gardener, \\u2018that is not the way.\\u2019 Then he pushed him\\r\\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\\r\\nwisdom dangling in the air. \\u2018How is it with thee, friend?\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\\r\\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student\\u2019s nag, and left the poor fellow\\r\\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother of Hans said: \\u2018Whither away, Hans?\\u2019 Hans answered: \\u2018To\\r\\nGretel.\\u2019 \\u2018Behave well, Hans.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ll behave well.

Where have you been?\\u2019 \\u2018With Gretel.\\u2019 \\u2018What did you take\\r\\nher?\\u2019 \\u2018I took her nothing.\\u2019 \\u2018What did Gretel give you?\\u2019 \\u2018She gave me\\r\\nnothing, she came with me.\\u2019 \\u2018Where have you left Gretel?\\u2019 \\u2018I led her by\\r\\nthe rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.\\u2019 \\u2018That\\r\\nwas ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.\\u2019 \\u2018Never\\r\\nmind, will do better.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHans went into the stable, cut out all the calves\\u2019 and sheep\\u2019s eyes,\\r\\nand threw them in Gretel\\u2019s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself\\r\\nloose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\\r\\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: \\u2018Hark you,\\r\\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from\\r\\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\\r\\nsee what he can do with you.\\u2019 The youth was sent into a strange town,\\r\\nand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,\\r\\nhe came home again, and his father asked: \\u2018Now, my son, what have you\\r\\nlearnt?\\u2019 \\u2018Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\\u2019 \\u2018Lord\\r\\nhave mercy on us!\\u2019 cried the father; \\u2018is that all you have learnt? I\\r\\nwill send you into another town, to another master.\\u2019 The youth was taken\\r\\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back\\r\\nthe father again asked: \\u2018My son, what have you learnt?\\u2019 He answered:\\r\\n\\u2018Father, I have learnt what the birds say.\\u2019 Then the father fell into a\\r\\nrage and said: \\u2018Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and\\r\\nlearnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will\\r\\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\\r\\nwill no longer be your father.\\u2019 The youth remained a whole year with the\\r\\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\\r\\n\\u2018My son, what have you learnt?\\u2019 he answered: \\u2018Dear father, I have this\\r\\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.\\u2019 Then the father fell into the most\\r\\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: \\u2018This man\\r\\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\\r\\nout into the forest, and kill him.\\u2019 They took him forth, but when they\\r\\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\\r\\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\\r\\nthem to the old man as a token.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\\r\\nbegged for a night\\u2019s lodging. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the lord of the castle, \\u2018if\\r\\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\\r\\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\\r\\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\\r\\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.\\u2019 The whole district was in\\r\\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\\r\\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: \\u2018Just let me\\r\\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\\r\\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.\\u2019 As he himself would have it so,\\r\\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\\r\\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\\r\\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\\r\\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\\r\\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\\r\\nthe castle: \\u2018The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\\r\\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\\r\\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\\r\\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\\r\\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.\\u2019 Then all who\\r\\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\\r\\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\\r\\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\\r\\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\\r\\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\\r\\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\\r\\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\\r\\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\\r\\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\\r\\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\\r\\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\\r\\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\\r\\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\\r\\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\\r\\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\\r\\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\\r\\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\\r\\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\\r\\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\\r\\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\\r\\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\\r\\nherself: \\u2018He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\\r\\nworld,\\u2019 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \\u2018Good day, dear Mr Fox,\\r\\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\\r\\ntimes?\\u2019 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\\r\\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\\r\\nany answer or not. At last he said: \\u2018Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\\r\\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\\r\\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\\r\\nmany arts do you understand?\\u2019 \\u2018I understand but one,\\u2019 replied the\\r\\ncat, modestly. \\u2018What art is that?\\u2019 asked the fox. \\u2018When the hounds are\\r\\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\\u2019 \\u2018Is that all?\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the fox. \\u2018I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\\r\\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\\r\\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.\\u2019 Just then came a hunter\\r\\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\\r\\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \\u2018Open your\\r\\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\\u2019 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\\r\\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. \\u2018Ah, Mr Fox,\\u2019 cried the\\r\\ncat. \\u2018You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\\r\\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Dear children,\\u2019 said a poor man to his four sons, \\u2018I have nothing to\\r\\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\\r\\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.\\u2019 So the\\r\\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\\r\\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\\r\\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\\r\\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\\r\\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\\r\\nhimself.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\\r\\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. \\u2018I am\\r\\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\\r\\nsome art or trade,\\u2019 answered he. \\u2018Then,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018go with me, and\\r\\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the other, \\u2018that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\\r\\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh!\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018you need\\r\\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\\r\\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\\r\\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.\\u2019 So the young man\\r\\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\\r\\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\\r\\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. \\u2018I do not\\r\\nknow yet,\\u2019 said he. \\u2018Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\\r\\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\\r\\nthe stars.\\u2019 The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\\r\\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\\r\\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, \\u2018With this you can see all\\r\\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\\r\\nyou.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\\r\\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\\r\\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\\r\\ndo. \\u2018Would not you like,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018to be a tailor?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, no!\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe young man; \\u2018sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\\r\\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Oh!\\u2019 answered the man, \\u2018that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\\r\\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.\\u2019 Not knowing\\r\\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\\r\\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\\r\\n\\u2018You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\\r\\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\\r\\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\\r\\nset off towards their father\\u2019s home, where they told him all that had\\r\\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\\r\\ntree, the father said, \\u2018I should like to try what each of you can do in\\r\\nthis way.\\u2019 So he looked up, and said to the second son, \\u2018At the top of\\r\\nthis tree there is a chaffinch\\u2019s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\\r\\nin it.\\u2019 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, \\u2018Five.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Now,\\u2019 said the father to the eldest son, \\u2018take away the eggs without\\r\\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\\r\\nanything of what you are doing.\\u2019 So the cunning thief climbed up the\\r\\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\\r\\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\\r\\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\\r\\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \\u2018Cut all\\r\\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.\\u2019 The huntsman took up his bow, and\\r\\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Now comes your turn,\\u2019 said he to the young tailor; \\u2018sew the eggs and\\r\\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\\r\\nhave done them no harm.\\u2019 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\\r\\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\\r\\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\\r\\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\\r\\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\\r\\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well done, sons!\\u2019 said the old man; \\u2018you have made good use of your\\r\\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\\r\\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\\r\\nyou to turn your skill to some account!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\\r\\nking\\u2019s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\\r\\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\\r\\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\\r\\nbrothers said to each other, \\u2018Here is a chance for us; let us try\\r\\nwhat we can do.\\u2019 And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\\r\\nprincess free. \\u2018I will soon find out where she is, however,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, \\u2018I\\r\\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\\r\\ndragon close by, guarding her.\\u2019 Then he went to the king, and asked for\\r\\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\\r\\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\\r\\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\\r\\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. \\u2018I dare not shoot at him,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the huntsman, \\u2018for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Then I will try my skill,\\u2019 said the thief, and went and stole her away\\r\\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\\r\\nit, but went on snoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\\r\\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\\r\\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\\r\\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\\r\\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\\r\\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\\r\\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\\r\\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\\r\\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\\r\\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\\r\\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\\r\\nreached the ship and got home safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\\r\\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, \\u2018One of you shall marry\\r\\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, \\u2018If I had\\r\\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\\u2019 \\u2018Your seeing her would have been of\\r\\nno use,\\u2019 said the thief, \\u2018if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\\u2019 \\u2018No, she is mine,\\u2019 said the huntsman;\\r\\n\\u2018for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\\r\\nand the princess into pieces.\\u2019 \\u2018And if I had not sewn the boat together\\r\\nagain,\\u2019 said the tailor, \\u2018you would all have been drowned, therefore she\\r\\nis mine.\\u2019 Then the king put in a word, and said, \\u2018Each of you is right;\\r\\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\\r\\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\\r\\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\\r\\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.\\u2019 So the brothers agreed that this\\r\\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\\r\\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\\r\\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\\r\\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\\r\\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\\r\\nher again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLILY AND THE LION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\\r\\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\\r\\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\\r\\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, \\u2018Dear father, bring me a\\r\\nrose.\\u2019 Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\\r\\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\\r\\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\\r\\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\\r\\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\\r\\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\\r\\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\\r\\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\\r\\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\\r\\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\\r\\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\\r\\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\\r\\ndreary and buried in the snow. \\u2018A lucky hit!\\u2019 said he, as he called to\\r\\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\\r\\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\\r\\nlion, and roared out, \\u2018Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\\r\\nalive!\\u2019 Then the man said, \\u2018I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\\r\\ncan nothing save my life?\\u2019 \\u2018No!\\u2019 said the lion, \\u2018nothing, unless you\\r\\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\\r\\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\\r\\ndaughter.\\u2019 But the man was unwilling to do so and said, \\u2018It may be my\\r\\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\\r\\nI go home.\\u2019 Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, \\u2018It may\\r\\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.\\u2019 And at last the man yielded with a\\r\\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\\r\\nshould meet him first on his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\\r\\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\\r\\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\\r\\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\\r\\nsaying, \\u2018Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\\r\\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\\r\\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.\\u2019 Then he told her all that\\r\\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she comforted him, and said, \\u2018Dear father, the word you have given\\r\\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\\r\\nme come safe home again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\\r\\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\\r\\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\\r\\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\\r\\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\\r\\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\\r\\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\\r\\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\\r\\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he said to her, \\u2018Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\\r\\nyour father\\u2019s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\\r\\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\\u2019 Then she\\r\\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\\r\\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\\r\\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\\r\\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\\r\\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, \\u2018I will not go alone this\\r\\ntime--you must go with me.\\u2019 But he would not, and said that it would be\\r\\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\\r\\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\\r\\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\\r\\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\\r\\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\\r\\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\\r\\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\\r\\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\\r\\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\\r\\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\\r\\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\\r\\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\\r\\n\\u2018Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\\r\\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\\r\\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\\r\\nfree.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\\r\\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\\r\\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\\r\\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\\r\\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\\r\\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\\r\\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\\r\\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\\r\\n\\u2018Now,\\u2019 thought she to herself, \\u2018no aid of man can be of use to me.\\u2019 So\\r\\nshe went to the sun and said, \\u2018Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill\\u2019s\\r\\ntop and the valley\\u2019s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018No,\\u2019 said the sun, \\u2018I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\\r\\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\\r\\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, \\u2018Thou shinest through the\\r\\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018No,\\u2019 said the moon, \\u2018I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\\r\\negg--break it when need comes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\\r\\nraised up her voice to it, and said, \\u2018Thou blowest through every tree\\r\\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nnight-wind, \\u2018but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\\r\\nit.\\u2019 Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\\r\\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, \\u2018I have seen the white dove--he\\r\\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\\r\\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\\r\\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\\r\\nyou.\\u2019 Then the night-wind said, \\u2018I will give thee counsel. Go to the\\r\\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\\r\\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\\r\\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\\r\\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\\r\\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\\r\\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\\r\\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,\\u2019 continued the night-wind.\\r\\n\\u2018When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\\r\\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\\r\\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\\r\\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\\r\\nyou both fall into the sea.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\\r\\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\\r\\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\\r\\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\\r\\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin\\u2019s back, and went off\\r\\ncarrying the prince away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\\r\\ntook heart and said, \\u2018As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\\r\\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.\\u2019 She went on for\\r\\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\\r\\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\\r\\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. \\u2018Heaven aid me now!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\\r\\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\\r\\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\\r\\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\\r\\nsold. \\u2018Not for gold and silver.\\u2019 said she, \\u2018but for flesh and blood.\\u2019\\r\\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, \\u2018Let me speak with the\\r\\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.\\u2019\\r\\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\\r\\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\\r\\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\\r\\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: \\u2018I have\\r\\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\\r\\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\\r\\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?\\u2019 But the prince all the time\\r\\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\\r\\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\\r\\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\\r\\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\\r\\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\\r\\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\\r\\nnestled under the old one\\u2019s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\\r\\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\\r\\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\\r\\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. \\u2018Not for gold or silver, but\\r\\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\\r\\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\\r\\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\\r\\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\\r\\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\\r\\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\\r\\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\\r\\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\\r\\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\\r\\nhe knew his beloved wife\\u2019s voice, and sprang up, and said, \\u2018You have\\r\\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\\r\\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\\r\\nyou to me in a lucky hour.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\\r\\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\\r\\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\\r\\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\\r\\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\\r\\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\\r\\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\\r\\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\\r\\nnothing more to eat, and said, \\u2018I want you no longer, so take yourself\\r\\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\\r\\nstronger than a lion.\\u2019 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\\r\\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\\r\\na fox met him: \\u2018What\\u2019s the matter, my friend?\\u2019 said he, \\u2018why do you hang\\r\\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\u2019 replied the\\r\\nhorse, \\u2018justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\\r\\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\\r\\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\\r\\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\\r\\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, \\u2018I will help you;\\r\\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\\r\\ndead.\\u2019 The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\\r\\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, \\u2018A little way off\\r\\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\\r\\nhis carcase.\\u2019 The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\\r\\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, \\u2018You will not be able to eat\\r\\nhim comfortably here; I\\u2019ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\\r\\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\\r\\nleisure.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\\r\\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\\r\\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\\r\\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\\r\\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, \\u2018Jip! Dobbin! Jip!\\u2019 Then up he sprang,\\r\\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\\r\\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\\r\\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\\r\\nmaster\\u2019s house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Here he is, master,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I have got the better of him\\u2019: and when\\r\\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. \\u2018Thou\\r\\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.\\u2019 And so the poor old\\r\\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\\r\\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\\r\\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\\r\\n\\u2018You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\\r\\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\\r\\nservice for them.\\u2019 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\\r\\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\\r\\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\\r\\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \\u2018Do give\\r\\nme one night\\u2019s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\\u2019 said he to\\r\\nher, \\u2018or I shall starve.\\u2019 \\u2018Oho!\\u2019 she answered, \\u2018who gives anything to a\\r\\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\\r\\nwill do what I wish.\\u2019 \\u2018What do you wish?\\u2019 said the soldier. \\u2018That you\\r\\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.\\u2019 The soldier consented,\\r\\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\\r\\nthe evening. \\u2018I see well enough,\\u2019 said the witch, \\u2018that you can do no\\r\\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\\r\\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.\\u2019 The\\r\\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\\r\\nproposed that he should stay one night more. \\u2018Tomorrow, you shall only\\r\\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\\r\\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\\r\\nout, and you shall bring it up again.\\u2019 Next day the old woman took him\\r\\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\\r\\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\\r\\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\\r\\nblue light away from him. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said he, perceiving her evil intention,\\r\\n\\u2018I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\\r\\nthe ground.\\u2019 The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\\r\\nwell, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\\r\\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\\r\\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\\r\\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\\r\\nwas still half full. \\u2018This shall be my last pleasure,\\u2019 thought he,\\r\\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\\r\\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\\r\\nbefore him, and said: \\u2018Lord, what are your commands?\\u2019 \\u2018What my commands\\r\\nare?\\u2019 replied the soldier, quite astonished. \\u2018I must do everything you\\r\\nbid me,\\u2019 said the little man. \\u2018Good,\\u2019 said the soldier; \\u2018then in the\\r\\nfirst place help me out of this well.\\u2019 The little man took him by the\\r\\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\\r\\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\\r\\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\\r\\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\\r\\nto the little man: \\u2018Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\\r\\nthe judge.\\u2019 In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\\r\\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\\r\\nreappeared. \\u2018It is all done,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018and the witch is already hanging\\r\\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?\\u2019 inquired the dwarf.\\r\\n\\u2018At this moment, none,\\u2019 answered the soldier; \\u2018you can return home, only\\r\\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.\\u2019 \\u2018Nothing more is needed than\\r\\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\\r\\nbefore you at once.\\u2019 Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\\r\\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\\r\\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\\r\\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\\r\\nand said: \\u2018I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\\r\\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\\u2019 \\u2018What am I to\\r\\ndo?\\u2019 asked the little man. \\u2018Late at night, when the king\\u2019s daughter is\\r\\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant\\u2019s work for\\r\\nme.\\u2019 The manikin said: \\u2018That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\\r\\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\\u2019\\r\\nWhen twelve o\\u2019clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\\r\\ncarried in the princess. \\u2018Aha! are you there?\\u2019 cried the soldier, \\u2018get\\r\\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.\\u2019 When\\r\\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\\r\\nstretched out his feet and said: \\u2018Pull off my boots,\\u2019 and then he\\r\\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\\r\\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\\r\\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\\r\\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\\r\\nin her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\\r\\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. \\u2018I was carried through the\\r\\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018and taken into a\\r\\nsoldier\\u2019s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\\r\\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\\r\\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018The dream may have been true,\\u2019 said the king. \\u2018I will give you a piece\\r\\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\\r\\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\\r\\nleave a track in the streets.\\u2019 But unseen by the king, the manikin was\\r\\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\\r\\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\\r\\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\\r\\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\\r\\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servant\\u2019s work until\\r\\ncock-crow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\\r\\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\\r\\npeas, and saying: \\u2018It must have rained peas, last night.\\u2019 \\u2018We must think\\r\\nof something else,\\u2019 said the king; \\u2018keep your shoes on when you go to\\r\\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\\r\\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\\u2019 The black manikin\\r\\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\\r\\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\\r\\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\\r\\nin the soldier\\u2019s house it would go badly with him. \\u2018Do what I bid you,\\u2019\\r\\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\\r\\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\\r\\nthe bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\\u2019s\\r\\nshoe. It was found at the soldier\\u2019s, and the soldier himself, who at the\\r\\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\\r\\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\\r\\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\\r\\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\\r\\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\\r\\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\\r\\nhim: \\u2018Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\\r\\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\\u2019 His comrade ran\\r\\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\\r\\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \\u2018Have no\\r\\nfear,\\u2019 said the latter to his master. \\u2018Go wheresoever they take you, and\\r\\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.\\u2019 Next day\\r\\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\\r\\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\\r\\nfavour of the king. \\u2018What is it?\\u2019 asked the king. \\u2018That I may smoke one\\r\\nmore pipe on my way.\\u2019 \\u2018You may smoke three,\\u2019 answered the king, \\u2018but do\\r\\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.\\u2019 Then the soldier pulled out\\r\\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\\r\\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\\r\\nhand, and said: \\u2018What does my lord command?\\u2019 \\u2018Strike down to earth that\\r\\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\\r\\ntreated me so ill.\\u2019 Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\\r\\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\\r\\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\\r\\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\\u2019s mercy, and merely to\\r\\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\\r\\ndaughter to wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RAVEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\\r\\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\\r\\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\\r\\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \\u2018I wish you\\r\\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\\u2019\\r\\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\\r\\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\\r\\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\\r\\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\\r\\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\\r\\nnear, the raven said, \\u2018I am by birth a king\\u2019s daughter, but am now under\\r\\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.\\u2019 \\u2018What\\r\\nam I to do?\\u2019 he asked. She replied, \\u2018Go farther into the wood until you\\r\\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\\r\\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\\r\\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\\r\\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\\r\\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two o\\u2019clock in the afternoon for\\r\\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\\r\\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\\r\\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, \\u2018Alas! I\\r\\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\\r\\nto save me.\\u2019 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\\r\\na thing to eat or drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\\r\\nsomething to eat and drink.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018No,\\u2019 answered the man, \\u2018I will neither eat not drink.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \\u2018If you will\\r\\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\\r\\ncounts for nothing,\\u2019 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\\r\\ndrank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\\r\\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\\r\\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\\r\\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\\r\\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\\r\\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\\r\\no\\u2019clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\\r\\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \\u2018I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep.\\u2019 When she entered the garden, there she found\\r\\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\\r\\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\\r\\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\\r\\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\\r\\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards two o\\u2019clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\\r\\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\\r\\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\\r\\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\\r\\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\\r\\nto herself, \\u2018I know he has fallen asleep.\\u2019 She went as before to look\\r\\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the old woman said to him, \\u2018What is this? You are not\\r\\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered, \\u2018I may not and will not either eat or drink.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\\r\\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\\r\\ntook a deep draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\\r\\nthe garden to await the king\\u2019s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\\r\\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\\r\\nhe slept like a log. At two o\\u2019clock the raven could be seen approaching,\\r\\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\\r\\nhorses, were black.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, \\u2018I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.\\u2019 She\\r\\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\\r\\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\\r\\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\\r\\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\\r\\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\\r\\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\\r\\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\\r\\n\\u2018I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\\r\\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\\r\\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.\\u2019 She then\\r\\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\\r\\nat heart, and said, \\u2018She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\\r\\nand it is now too late for me to save her.\\u2019 Then his eyes fell on the\\r\\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\\r\\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\\r\\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\\r\\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\\r\\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\\r\\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\\r\\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\\r\\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\\r\\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\\r\\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\\r\\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\\r\\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\\r\\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\\r\\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \\u2018If the giant\\r\\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.\\u2019 However, after a\\r\\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\\r\\nhe called out, \\u2018It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\\r\\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\\u2019 \\u2018I\\r\\nwould rather you let that alone,\\u2019 said the man, \\u2018for I do not willingly\\r\\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\\r\\nsatisfy your hunger.\\u2019 \\u2018If that is so,\\u2019 replied the giant, \\u2018I will leave\\r\\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\\r\\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\\r\\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\\r\\nate and drank to his heart\\u2019s content. When he had finished his supper\\r\\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\\r\\nThe giant said, \\u2018I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\\r\\nvillages, and houses.\\u2019 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\\r\\nbut could not find it. \\u2018Never mind,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018I have larger maps\\r\\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,\\u2019 but they searched in\\r\\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\\r\\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\\r\\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\\r\\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\\r\\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\\r\\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\\r\\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\\r\\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\\r\\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\\r\\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. \\u2018How shall I\\r\\nbe able to get there?\\u2019 asked the man. \\u2018I have two hours to spare,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe giant, \\u2018and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\\r\\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\\r\\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, \\u2018You will be able to walk the\\r\\nremainder of the way yourself.\\u2019 The man journeyed on day and night\\r\\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\\r\\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\\r\\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\\r\\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\\r\\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\\r\\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\\r\\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, \\u2018I will remain here and wait for\\r\\nher,\\u2019 so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\\r\\na whole year, and every day he saw the king\\u2019s daughter driving round her\\r\\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\\r\\ncalled out to them, \\u2018God be with you.\\u2019 They stopped when they heard the\\r\\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\\r\\nfighting, which now became more furious. \\u2018God be with you,\\u2019 he cried\\r\\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\\r\\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, \\u2018God be with you,\\u2019\\r\\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\\r\\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\\r\\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\\r\\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\\r\\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\\r\\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\\r\\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\\r\\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\\r\\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\\r\\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, \\u2018I will give you something in\\r\\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\\r\\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\\r\\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.\\u2019 The\\r\\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\\r\\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\\r\\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\\r\\nanother, crying, \\u2018There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\\r\\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\\r\\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\\r\\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\\r\\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\\r\\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\\r\\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\\r\\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\\r\\n\\u2018That is my own ring,\\u2019 she exclaimed, \\u2018and if that is so the man must\\r\\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\\r\\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\\r\\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\\r\\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\\r\\nshe kissed him, and said, \\u2018Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\\r\\nwe will celebrate our marriage.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\\r\\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] Simpleton\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\\r\\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\\r\\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\\r\\nhim good day, and said: \\u2018Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\\r\\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\\u2019 But\\r\\nthe clever son answered: \\u2018If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\\r\\nnone for myself; be off with you,\\u2019 and he left the little man standing\\r\\nand went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\\r\\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\\r\\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\\u2019s doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\\r\\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\\r\\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\\r\\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: \\u2018What I give you will be\\r\\ntaken away from myself; be off!\\u2019 and he left the little man standing and\\r\\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\\r\\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\\r\\ncarried home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Dummling said: \\u2018Father, do let me go and cut wood.\\u2019 The father\\r\\nanswered: \\u2018Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\\r\\nyou do not understand anything about it.\\u2019 But Dummling begged so long\\r\\nthat at last he said: \\u2018Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\\r\\nyourself.\\u2019 His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\\r\\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\\r\\nand greeting him, said: \\u2018Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\\r\\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.\\u2019 Dummling answered: \\u2018I have\\r\\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\\r\\ndown and eat.\\u2019 So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\\r\\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\\r\\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: \\u2018Since\\r\\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\\r\\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\\r\\nfind something at the roots.\\u2019 Then the little man took leave of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\\r\\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\\r\\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\\r\\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\\r\\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\\r\\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest thought: \\u2018I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\\r\\nfeather,\\u2019 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\\r\\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\\r\\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\\r\\nwas held fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\\r\\nscreamed out: \\u2018Keep away; for goodness\\u2019 sake keep away!\\u2019 But she did\\r\\nnot understand why she was to keep away. \\u2018The others are there,\\u2019 she\\r\\nthought, \\u2018I may as well be there too,\\u2019 and ran to them; but as soon as\\r\\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\\r\\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\\r\\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\\r\\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\\r\\nwherever his legs took him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\\r\\nprocession he said: \\u2018For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\\r\\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?\\u2019 At the\\r\\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\\r\\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\\r\\nobliged to run behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\\r\\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: \\u2018Hi!\\r\\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\\r\\nchristening today!\\u2019 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\\r\\nwas also held fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\\r\\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\\r\\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\\r\\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\\r\\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\\r\\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\\r\\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\\r\\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\\r\\nbefore the king\\u2019s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\\r\\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\\r\\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\\r\\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\\r\\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\\r\\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\\r\\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\\r\\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\\r\\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\\r\\nsorely, and he answered: \\u2018I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\\r\\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\\r\\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018There, I can help you,\\u2019 said Dummling, \\u2018just come with me and you shall\\r\\nbe satisfied.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led him into the king\\u2019s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\\r\\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\\r\\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\\r\\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\\r\\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\\r\\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\\r\\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\\r\\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\\r\\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: \\u2018I have eaten a\\r\\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\\r\\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\\r\\ndie of hunger.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: \\u2018Get up and come with me; you shall\\r\\neat yourself full.\\u2019 He led him to the king\\u2019s palace where all the\\r\\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\\r\\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\\r\\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\\r\\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\\r\\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\\r\\nwater. \\u2018As soon as you come sailing back in it,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018you shall\\r\\nhave my daughter for wife.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\\r\\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\\r\\nhe said: \\u2018Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\\r\\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.\\u2019 Then he\\r\\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\\r\\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\\r\\nwedding was celebrated, and after the king\\u2019s death, Dummling inherited\\r\\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\\r\\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\\r\\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\\r\\nat their father\\u2019s sickness; and as they were walking together very\\r\\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\\r\\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\\r\\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. \\u2018I know what would,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the little old man; \\u2018it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\\r\\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nthe eldest son said, \\u2018I will soon find it\\u2019: and he went to the sick\\r\\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\\r\\nit was the only thing that could save him. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the king. \\u2018I had\\r\\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\\r\\nyour journey.\\u2019 But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\\r\\nprince thought to himself, \\u2018If I bring my father this water, he will\\r\\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\\r\\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\\r\\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\\r\\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\\r\\n\\u2018Prince, whither so fast?\\u2019 \\u2018What is that to thee, you ugly imp?\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\\r\\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\\r\\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\\r\\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\\r\\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\\r\\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\\r\\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\\r\\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\\r\\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\\u2019s\\r\\nreturn, till at last the second son said, \\u2018Father, I will go in search\\r\\nof the Water of Life.\\u2019 For he thought to himself, \\u2018My brother is surely\\r\\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\\u2019 The king was\\r\\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\\r\\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\\r\\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\\r\\nmountains, saying, as before, \\u2018Prince, prince, whither so fast?\\u2019 \\u2018Mind\\r\\nyour own affairs, busybody!\\u2019 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\\r\\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\\r\\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\\r\\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\\r\\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\\r\\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\\r\\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Prince, whither so fast?\\u2019 And the prince said, \\u2018I am going in\\r\\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\\r\\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!\\u2019 \\u2018Do you know\\r\\nwhere it is to be found?\\u2019 asked the dwarf. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the prince, \\u2018I do\\r\\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.\\u2019 \\u2018Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\\r\\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\\r\\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\\r\\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\\r\\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\\r\\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\\r\\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\\r\\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\\r\\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\\r\\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\\r\\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\\r\\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey\\u2019s end, and\\r\\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\\r\\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\\r\\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\\r\\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\\r\\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\\r\\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\\r\\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\\r\\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\\r\\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\\r\\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\\r\\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\\r\\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\\r\\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\\r\\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\\r\\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\\r\\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\\r\\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\\r\\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\\r\\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\\r\\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\\r\\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\\r\\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\\r\\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, \\u2018You\\r\\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\\r\\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.\\u2019 Then the prince thought\\r\\nto himself, \\u2018I cannot go home to my father without my brothers\\u2019; so he\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\\r\\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,\\u2019 said the dwarf,\\r\\n\\u2018because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.\\u2019\\r\\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\\r\\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, \\u2018Beware of them, for they have\\r\\nbad hearts.\\u2019 Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\\r\\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\\r\\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\\r\\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\\r\\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\\r\\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\\r\\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\\r\\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\\r\\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemy\\u2019s army with it; and thus the\\r\\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\\r\\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\\r\\nthe two eldest said to themselves, \\u2018Our brother has got the water which\\r\\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\\r\\nkingdom, which is our right\\u2019; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\\r\\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\\r\\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\\r\\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to their journey\\u2019s end, the youngest son brought his cup\\r\\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\\r\\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\\r\\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\\r\\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\\r\\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\\r\\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\\r\\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\\r\\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \\u2018Well,\\r\\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\\r\\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\\r\\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\\r\\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\\r\\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\\r\\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\\r\\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\\r\\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\\r\\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\\r\\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\\r\\nday, when the king\\u2019s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\\r\\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\\r\\nthe prince said, \\u2018My friend, what is the matter with you?\\u2019 \\u2018I cannot and\\r\\ndare not tell you,\\u2019 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\\r\\n\\u2018Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\\r\\nforgive you.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said the huntsman; \\u2018the king has ordered me to\\r\\nshoot you.\\u2019 The prince started at this, and said, \\u2018Let me live, and I\\r\\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\\r\\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.\\u2019 \\u2018With all my heart,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe huntsman; \\u2018I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\\r\\nhave shot you.\\u2019 Then he took the prince\\u2019s coat, and gave him the shabby\\r\\none, and went away through the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\\u2019s court,\\r\\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\\r\\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\\r\\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\\r\\npeople. This touched the old king\\u2019s heart, and he thought his son might\\r\\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, \\u2018O that my son were still\\r\\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!\\u2019 \\u2018He is still alive,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the huntsman; \\u2018and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\\r\\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.\\u2019 At this the king was\\r\\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\\r\\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\\r\\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\\r\\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\\r\\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\\r\\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\\r\\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\\r\\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\\r\\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\\r\\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\\r\\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, \\u2018It is a pity to ride upon this\\r\\nbeautiful road\\u2019; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\\r\\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\\r\\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\\r\\nabout his business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\\r\\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\\r\\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\\r\\nhimself, \\u2018What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\\u2019 Then he\\r\\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\\r\\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\\r\\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\\r\\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his father\\u2019s anger, and set out in\\r\\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\\r\\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\\r\\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\\r\\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\\r\\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\\r\\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\\r\\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\\r\\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\\r\\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\\r\\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\\r\\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\\r\\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\\r\\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\\r\\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\\r\\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\\r\\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\\r\\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\\r\\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\\r\\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\\r\\n  And feasted and frolick\\u2019d I can\\u2019t tell how long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a king\\u2019s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\\r\\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\\r\\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\\r\\nThen he said to his beloved: \\u2018I must now go and leave you, I give you\\r\\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\\r\\nyou.\\u2019 So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\\r\\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \\u2018Dear son, I wished\\r\\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\\u2019 and\\r\\nhe named a certain king\\u2019s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\\r\\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \\u2018Yes,\\r\\ndear father, your will shall be done,\\u2019 and thereupon the king shut his\\r\\neyes, and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\\r\\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\\r\\nhis father, and caused the king\\u2019s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\\r\\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\\r\\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\\r\\nsaid to her: \\u2018Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\\r\\nwhatsoever you will.\\u2019 She thought for a moment and said: \\u2018Dear father,\\r\\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\\u2019\\r\\nThe father said: \\u2018If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\\u2019\\r\\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\\r\\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\\r\\nfigure, and size.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the king\\u2019s daughter, she had twelve suits of\\r\\nhuntsmen\\u2019s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\\r\\non the huntsmen\\u2019s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\\r\\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\\r\\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\\r\\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\\r\\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\\r\\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 and that he would\\r\\nwillingly take them, and now they were the king\\u2019s twelve huntsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\\r\\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\\r\\nsaid to the king: \\u2018You think you have twelve huntsmen?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nking, \\u2018they are twelve huntsmen.\\u2019 The lion continued: \\u2018You are mistaken,\\r\\nthey are twelve girls.\\u2019 The king said: \\u2018That cannot be true! How\\r\\nwill you prove that to me?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\\r\\nante-chamber,\\u2019 answered the lion, \\u2018and then you will soon see. Men have\\r\\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\\r\\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\\u2019 The king\\r\\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, however, a servant of the king\\u2019s who favoured the huntsmen,\\r\\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\\r\\nthem and repeated everything, and said: \\u2018The lion wants to make the king\\r\\nbelieve that you are girls.\\u2019 Then the king\\u2019s daughter thanked him, and\\r\\nsaid to her maidens: \\u2018Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\\u2019\\r\\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\\r\\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\\r\\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\\r\\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\\r\\nand the king said to the lion: \\u2018You have lied to me, they walk just like\\r\\nmen.\\u2019 The lion said: \\u2018They have been informed that they were going to\\r\\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\\r\\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\\r\\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\\u2019\\r\\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\\r\\nante-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\\r\\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\\u2019s daughter\\r\\nsaid to her eleven girls: \\u2018Show some constraint, and do not look round\\r\\nat the spinning-wheels.\\u2019 And next morning when the king had his twelve\\r\\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\\r\\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\\r\\n\\u2018You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\\r\\nspinning-wheels.\\u2019 The lion replied: \\u2018They have restrained themselves.\\u2019\\r\\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\\r\\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\\r\\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the king\\u2019s bride was\\r\\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\\r\\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\\r\\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\\r\\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\\r\\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\\r\\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\\r\\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: \\u2018You are mine, and I am yours, and\\r\\nno one in the world can alter that.\\u2019 He sent a messenger to the other\\r\\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\\r\\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\\r\\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\\r\\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\\r\\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\\r\\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\\r\\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\\r\\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\\r\\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\\r\\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\\r\\nhis trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\\r\\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\\r\\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\\r\\nblack dwarf. \\u2018Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\\u2019 said he to the\\r\\nmerchant; \\u2018what is it you take so deeply to heart?\\u2019 \\u2018If you would do me\\r\\nany good I would willingly tell you,\\u2019 said the merchant. \\u2018Who knows but\\r\\nI may?\\u2019 said the little man: \\u2018tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\\r\\nwill find I may be of some use.\\u2019 Then the merchant told him how all his\\r\\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\\r\\nbut that little plot of land. \\u2018Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the dwarf; \\u2018only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\\r\\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\\r\\nas you please.\\u2019 The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\\r\\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\\r\\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\\r\\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\\r\\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\\r\\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\\r\\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\\r\\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\\r\\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\\r\\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\\r\\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\\r\\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\\r\\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\\r\\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\\r\\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\\r\\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\\r\\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\\r\\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\\r\\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\\r\\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\\r\\ntoo much for the little man.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\\r\\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\\r\\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\\r\\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\\r\\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\\r\\nlast the boy said to him. \\u2018Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\\r\\nwhat do you want?\\u2019 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\\r\\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\\r\\ngood luck was in store for him. \\u2018Have you brought me what you said you\\r\\nwould?\\u2019 said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\\r\\nHeinel said again, \\u2018What do you want here?\\u2019 The dwarf said, \\u2018I come to\\r\\ntalk with your father, not with you.\\u2019 \\u2018You have cheated and taken in my\\r\\nfather,\\u2019 said the son; \\u2018pray give him up his bond at once.\\u2019 \\u2018Fair and\\r\\nsoftly,\\u2019 said the little old man; \\u2018right is right; I have paid my money,\\r\\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\\r\\nhave what I paid it for.\\u2019 \\u2018You must have my consent to that first,\\u2019 said\\r\\nHeinel, \\u2018so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.\\u2019 The old\\r\\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\\r\\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\\r\\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\\r\\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\\r\\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\\r\\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\\r\\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\\r\\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\\r\\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\\r\\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\\r\\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\\r\\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\\r\\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\\r\\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\\r\\nany rate he had had his revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\\r\\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\\r\\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\\r\\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\\r\\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \\u2018Here,\\u2019 said he to\\r\\nhimself, \\u2018must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\\u2019 So he once\\r\\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\\r\\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\\r\\nto see him, and said, \\u2018Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\\r\\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\\r\\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\\r\\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\\r\\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\\r\\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\\r\\nspeak not a word, and at twelve o\\u2019clock they must go away. The second\\r\\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\\r\\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\\r\\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\\r\\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\\r\\nand health.\\u2019 And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\\r\\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\\r\\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\\r\\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\\r\\nMountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\\r\\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\\r\\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\\r\\nagainst his going, and said, \\u2018I know well that misfortunes will come\\r\\nupon us if you go.\\u2019 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\\r\\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \\u2018Take this ring, and\\r\\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\\r\\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your father\\u2019s house.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\\r\\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\\r\\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\\r\\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\\r\\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\\u2019s\\r\\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\\r\\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\\r\\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\\r\\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\\r\\nhe was his son, and said, \\u2018Is there no mark by which you would know me\\r\\nif I am really your son?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said his mother, \\u2018our Heinel had a mark\\r\\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.\\u2019 Then he showed them the mark, and\\r\\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\\r\\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\\r\\nsaid, \\u2018that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\\r\\nabout in a shepherd\\u2019s frock!\\u2019 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\\r\\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\\r\\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\\r\\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\\r\\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\\r\\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\\r\\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\\r\\nhimself down, and said, \\u2018I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\\r\\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.\\u2019 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\\r\\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\\r\\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\\r\\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\\r\\n\\u2018I can never go back to my father\\u2019s house,\\u2019 said he; \\u2018they would say I\\r\\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\\r\\nmy kingdom.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\\r\\ngiants were sharing their father\\u2019s goods; and as they saw him pass they\\r\\ncried out and said, \\u2018Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\\r\\nbetween us.\\u2019 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\\u2019s head whenever\\r\\nthe wearer gave the words, \\u2018Heads off!\\u2019; a cloak that made the owner\\r\\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\\r\\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\\r\\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\\r\\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\\r\\nand in a moment he was a fly. \\u2018The cloak is very well,\\u2019 said he: \\u2018now\\r\\ngive me the sword.\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said they; \\u2018not unless you undertake not to\\r\\nsay, \\u201cHeads off!\\u201d for if you do we are all dead men.\\u2019 So they gave it\\r\\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\\r\\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\\r\\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\\r\\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\\r\\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\\r\\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\\r\\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\\r\\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\\r\\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\\r\\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\\r\\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\\r\\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \\u2018Alas!\\u2019 said\\r\\nshe to herself, \\u2018was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\\r\\nstill seem to bind me?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018False and fickle one!\\u2019 said he. \\u2018One indeed came who set thee free, and\\r\\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\\r\\nhave had such treatment from thee?\\u2019 Then he went out and sent away the\\r\\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\\r\\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\\r\\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\\r\\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\\r\\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. \\u2018Heads Off!\\u2019 cried he; and with the\\r\\nword the traitors\\u2019 heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\\r\\nof the Golden Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\\r\\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\\r\\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\\r\\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\\r\\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\\r\\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. \\u2018Oh, yes,\\u2019 said the doctor,\\r\\n\\u2018that is soon managed.\\u2019 \\u2018What must I do?\\u2019 asked the peasant. \\u2018In the\\r\\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\\r\\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\\r\\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\\r\\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \\u201cI\\r\\nam Doctor Knowall,\\u201d and have that nailed up above your house-door.\\u2019 The\\r\\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\\r\\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\\r\\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\\r\\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\\r\\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\\r\\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\\r\\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. \\u2018Oh, yes, but Grete, my\\r\\nwife, must go too.\\u2019 The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\\r\\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\\r\\nto the nobleman\\u2019s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\\r\\nsit down and eat. \\u2018Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,\\u2019 said he, and he seated\\r\\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\\r\\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: \\u2018Grete,\\r\\nthat was the first,\\u2019 meaning that was the servant who brought the first\\r\\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: \\u2018That is\\r\\nthe first thief,\\u2019 and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\\r\\nto his comrade outside: \\u2018The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\\r\\nsaid I was the first.\\u2019 The second did not want to go in at all, but was\\r\\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\\r\\nand said: \\u2018Grete, that is the second.\\u2019 This servant was equally alarmed,\\r\\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\\r\\npeasant again said: \\u2018Grete, that is the third.\\u2019 The fourth had to carry\\r\\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\\r\\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\\r\\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\\r\\ncried: \\u2018Ah, poor Crabb.\\u2019 When the lord heard that, he cried: \\u2018There! he\\r\\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\\r\\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\\r\\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\\r\\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\\r\\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\\r\\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\\r\\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\\r\\nsat down to the table, and said: \\u2018My lord, now will I search in my book\\r\\nwhere the gold is hidden.\\u2019 The fifth servant, however, crept into the\\r\\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\\r\\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\\r\\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: \\u2018I\\r\\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!\\u2019 Then the fellow in the\\r\\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\\r\\ncrying: \\u2018That man knows everything!\\u2019 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\\r\\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\\r\\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\\r\\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\\r\\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\\r\\nchristened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\\r\\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\\r\\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\\r\\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\\r\\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\\r\\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\\r\\nyoung men stay so long. \\u2018Surely,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018the whole seven must have\\r\\nforgotten themselves over some game of play\\u2019; and when he had waited\\r\\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\\r\\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\\r\\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\\r\\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\\r\\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\\r\\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\\r\\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\\r\\nmore beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\\r\\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\\r\\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthey, \\u2018she is beautiful indeed, but still \\u2018tis a pity that her brothers\\r\\nshould have been lost for her sake.\\u2019 Then she was much grieved, and went\\r\\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\\r\\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\\r\\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\\r\\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\\r\\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\\r\\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\\r\\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\\r\\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\\r\\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\\r\\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\\r\\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\\r\\njourneyed till she came to the world\\u2019s end; then she came to the sun,\\r\\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\\r\\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, \\u2018I smell flesh\\r\\nand blood this way!\\u2019 so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\\r\\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\\r\\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\\r\\nlittle piece of wood, and said, \\u2018If you have not this little piece of\\r\\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\\r\\nand there your brothers live.\\u2019 The little girl took the piece of wood,\\r\\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\\r\\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\\r\\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\\r\\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\\r\\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\\r\\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\\r\\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\\r\\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, \\u2018What are you\\r\\nseeking for?\\u2019 \\u2018I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,\\u2019 answered she.\\r\\nThen the dwarf said, \\u2018My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\\r\\ntill they come, pray step in.\\u2019 Now the little dwarf was getting their\\r\\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\\r\\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\\r\\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\\r\\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\\r\\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\\r\\ndwarf said, \\u2018Here come my masters.\\u2019 When they came in, they wanted to\\r\\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\\r\\none after the other,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\\r\\nlittle glass?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Caw! Caw! well I ween\\r\\n  Mortal lips have this way been.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\\r\\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father\\u2019s and mother\\u2019s,\\r\\nand said, \\u2018O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\\r\\nfree.\\u2019 When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\\r\\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\\r\\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\\r\\nother, and went merrily home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\\r\\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\\r\\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\\r\\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\\r\\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\\r\\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\\r\\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\\r\\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018What may you be about, Miss Cat?\\r\\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018I am not sleeping, I am waking,\\r\\n  Would you know what I am making?\\r\\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest for supper?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018No, thank you, miss,\\u2019 said the fox, \\u2018what is Mrs Fox doing?\\u2019 The maid\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018She is sitting in her room,\\r\\n  Moaning in her gloom,\\r\\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\\r\\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\\r\\nher.\\u2019 \\u2018Certainly, young sir.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\\r\\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\\r\\n \\u2018Mistress Fox, are you inside?\\u2019\\r\\n \\u2018Oh, yes, my little cat,\\u2019 she cried.\\r\\n \\u2018A wooer he stands at the door out there.\\u2019\\r\\n \\u2018What does he look like, my dear?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\\u2019 \\u2018Oh, no,\\u2019 answered\\r\\nthe cat, \\u2018he has only one.\\u2019 \\u2018Then I will not have him.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\\r\\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\\r\\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\\r\\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\\r\\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\\r\\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Now open the gates and doors all wide,\\r\\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\\r\\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\\r\\nFox out of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\\r\\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\\r\\nwolf greeted her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\\r\\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\\r\\n  What are you making good?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018In milk I\\u2019m breaking bread so sweet,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\\u2019 answered the wolf. \\u2018Is Mrs Fox not at home?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat said:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018She sits upstairs in her room,\\r\\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\\r\\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\\r\\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018If she\\u2019s in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please her to step below?\\u2019\\r\\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\\r\\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\\r\\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\\r\\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\\r\\n \\u2018Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\\r\\n  If you\\u2019re in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please you to step below?\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Fox asked: \\u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\\r\\nmouth?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 answered the cat. \\u2018Then he won\\u2019t do for me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\\r\\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\\r\\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\\r\\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: \\u2018Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\\r\\nlittle pointed mouth?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said the cat, \\u2018he has.\\u2019 \\u2018Then let him come\\r\\nupstairs,\\u2019 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\\r\\nfeast.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\u2018Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\\r\\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\\r\\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\\r\\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\\r\\n  But ate up every one he caught.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\\r\\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SALAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\\r\\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, \\u2018Good day, good day;\\r\\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\\r\\nsomething to eat.\\u2019 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\\r\\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\\r\\nshe took hold of him, and said, \\u2018Listen, my friend, to what I am going\\r\\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\\r\\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\\r\\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\\r\\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\\r\\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\\r\\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\\r\\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\\r\\nis the bird\\u2019s heart that will bring you this good luck.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \\u2018If all this does\\r\\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.\\u2019 When he had gone a hundred\\r\\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\\r\\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\\r\\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\\r\\neach wished to have it himself. \\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the huntsman, \\u2018this is\\r\\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said\\u2019; then he shot into\\r\\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\\r\\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\\r\\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\\r\\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\\r\\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\\r\\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\\r\\nat last thought to himself, \\u2018Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\\r\\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\\r\\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\\r\\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\\r\\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\\r\\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\\r\\nsaid to the young lady, \\u2018There is a young man coming out of the wood who\\r\\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\\r\\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\\u2019s heart that\\r\\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.\\u2019 Meantime the\\r\\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \\u2018I\\r\\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\\r\\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want\\u2019;\\r\\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\\r\\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\\r\\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\\r\\nbut looking at the lady\\u2019s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\\r\\nThen the old woman said, \\u2018Now is the time for getting the bird\\u2019s heart.\\u2019\\r\\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\\r\\npillow, for it lay now under the young lady\\u2019s, and the old woman took it\\r\\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\\r\\nprize.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Well,\\u2019 said the old witch, \\u2018we have got the bird\\u2019s heart, but not the\\r\\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\\u2019 \\u2018Let us leave him that,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the young lady; \\u2018he has already lost his wealth.\\u2019 Then the witch\\r\\nwas very angry, and said, \\u2018Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\\r\\nthing, and I must and will have it.\\u2019 So she did as the old woman told\\r\\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\\r\\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \\u2018What makes you so sad?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Alas! dear sir,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018yonder lies the granite rock where all the\\r\\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\\r\\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\\r\\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.\\u2019 \\u2018If that\\u2019s all your grief,\\u2019 said\\r\\nthe huntsman, \\u2018I\\u2019ll take you there with all my heart\\u2019; so he drew her under\\r\\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\\r\\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\\r\\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\\r\\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \\u2018Let us\\r\\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\\r\\nany longer.\\u2019 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\\r\\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\\r\\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\\r\\nherself home again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\\r\\nalone on the wild rock, he said, \\u2018Alas! what roguery there is in the\\r\\nworld!\\u2019 and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\\r\\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\\r\\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, \\u2018I can only\\r\\nsave myself by feigning to be asleep\\u2019; so he laid himself down as if he\\r\\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\\r\\nhim with his foot, and said, \\u2018What worm is this that lies here curled\\r\\nup?\\u2019 \\u2018Tread upon him and kill him,\\u2019 said the second. \\u2018It\\u2019s not worth the\\r\\ntrouble,\\u2019 said the third; \\u2018let him live, he\\u2019ll go climbing higher up the\\r\\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\\u2019 And they\\r\\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\\r\\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\\r\\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\\r\\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\\r\\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked around him, and said, \\u2018I wish I had something to eat, if\\r\\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\\r\\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\\u2019 At last he\\r\\nthought to himself, \\u2018I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\\r\\nme.\\u2019 So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\\r\\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\\r\\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\\r\\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\\r\\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\\r\\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\\r\\nhave found his old shape again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\\r\\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, \\u2018This will help me to my fortune\\r\\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\\u2019 So he\\r\\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\\r\\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\\r\\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\\r\\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; \\u2018I am so tired,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018that I\\r\\ncan go no farther.\\u2019 \\u2018Countryman,\\u2019 said the witch, \\u2018who are you? and what\\r\\nis your business?\\u2019 \\u2018I am,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018a messenger sent by the king to\\r\\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\\r\\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I don\\u2019t know that I can carry\\r\\nit farther.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\\r\\nlonged to taste it, and said, \\u2018Dear countryman, let us just taste it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018To be sure,\\u2019 answered he; \\u2018I have two heads of it with me, and will\\r\\ngive you one\\u2019; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\\r\\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\\r\\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\\r\\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\\r\\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\\r\\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\\r\\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\\r\\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\\r\\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\\r\\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\\r\\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\\r\\nlonged to taste it, she said, \\u2018I don\\u2019t know where the salad can be.\\u2019\\r\\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, \\u2018I will go\\r\\ninto the kitchen and see.\\u2019 And as he went he saw two asses in the court\\r\\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. \\u2018All right!\\u2019 said\\r\\nhe; \\u2018those two have had their share.\\u2019 Then he took up the rest of\\r\\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\\r\\nsaying, \\u2018I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.\\u2019\\r\\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\\r\\nmight know him. \\u2018Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\\u2019 said he; and\\r\\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\\r\\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. \\u2018What\\u2019s the matter?\\u2019 said the\\r\\nmiller. \\u2018I have three tiresome beasts here,\\u2019 said the other; \\u2018if you\\r\\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\\r\\nI will pay you whatever you ask.\\u2019 \\u2018With all my heart,\\u2019 said the miller;\\r\\n\\u2018but how shall I treat them?\\u2019 Then the huntsman said, \\u2018Give the old\\r\\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\\r\\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\\r\\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\\r\\nno stripes\\u2019: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\\r\\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\\r\\nwanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\\r\\nwas dead; \\u2018The other two,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018are alive and eat, but are so\\r\\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.\\u2019 Then the huntsman pitied them,\\r\\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\\r\\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\\r\\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, \\u2018O dearest huntsman! forgive\\r\\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\\r\\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\\r\\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird\\u2019s heart, I will give it you\\r\\ntoo.\\u2019 But he said, \\u2018Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\\r\\nto make you my wife.\\u2019 So they were married, and lived together very\\r\\nhappily till they died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\\r\\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\\r\\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\\r\\n\\u2018There\\u2019s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\\u2019 When anything\\r\\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\\r\\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\\r\\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\\r\\nplace, he answered: \\u2018Oh, no father, I\\u2019ll not go there, it makes me\\r\\nshudder!\\u2019 for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\\r\\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \\u2018Oh,\\r\\nit makes us shudder!\\u2019 The younger sat in a corner and listened with\\r\\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. \\u2018They are\\r\\nalways saying: \\u201cIt makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!\\u201d It does not\\r\\nmake me shudder,\\u2019 thought he. \\u2018That, too, must be an art of which I\\r\\nunderstand nothing!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \\u2018Hearken to me,\\r\\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\\r\\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\\r\\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\\u2019 \\u2018Well, father,\\u2019 he\\r\\nreplied, \\u2018I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\\r\\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\\u2019t understand\\r\\nthat at all yet.\\u2019 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\\r\\nthought to himself: \\u2018Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\\r\\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\\r\\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father sighed, and answered him: \\u2018You shall soon learn what it is to\\r\\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\\r\\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\\r\\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \\u2018Just think,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid he, \\u2018when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\\r\\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.\\u2019 \\u2018If that be all,\\u2019 replied the\\r\\nsexton, \\u2018he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\\r\\npolish him.\\u2019 The father was glad to do it, for he thought: \\u2018It will\\r\\ntrain the boy a little.\\u2019 The sexton therefore took him into his house,\\r\\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\\r\\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\\r\\nring the bell. \\u2018You shall soon learn what shuddering is,\\u2019 thought he,\\r\\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\\r\\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\\r\\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\\r\\nhole. \\u2018Who is there?\\u2019 cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\\r\\nnot move or stir. \\u2018Give an answer,\\u2019 cried the boy, \\u2018or take yourself\\r\\noff, you have no business here at night.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\\r\\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \\u2018What do you want\\r\\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\\r\\nsteps!\\u2019 The sexton thought: \\u2018He can\\u2019t mean to be as bad as his words,\\u2019\\r\\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\\r\\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\\r\\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\\r\\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\\r\\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\\r\\nfell asleep. The sexton\\u2019s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\\r\\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\\r\\nand asked: \\u2018Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\\r\\nbefore you did.\\u2019 \\u2018No, I don\\u2019t know,\\u2019 replied the boy, \\u2018but someone was\\r\\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\\r\\nwould neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\\r\\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\\r\\nI should be sorry if it were.\\u2019 The woman ran away and found her husband,\\r\\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\\r\\nboy\\u2019s father, \\u2018Your boy,\\u2019 cried she, \\u2018has been the cause of a great\\r\\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\\r\\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\\u2019 The father was\\r\\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. \\u2018What wicked tricks\\r\\nare these?\\u2019 said he. \\u2018The devil must have put them into your head.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Father,\\u2019 he replied, \\u2018do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\\r\\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\\r\\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\\r\\naway.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 said the father, \\u2018I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\\r\\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\\r\\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\\r\\nunderstand one art which will support me.\\u2019 \\u2018Learn what you will,\\u2019 spoke\\r\\nthe father, \\u2018it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\\r\\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\\r\\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\\r\\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\\r\\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\\r\\nhimself: \\u2018If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\\u2019 Then a man\\r\\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\\r\\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\\r\\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: \\u2018Look, there is the tree where\\r\\nseven men have married the ropemaker\\u2019s daughter, and are now learning\\r\\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\\r\\nsoon learn how to shudder.\\u2019 \\u2018If that is all that is wanted,\\u2019 answered\\r\\nthe youth, \\u2018it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\\r\\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\\r\\nmorning.\\u2019 Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\\r\\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\\r\\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\\r\\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\\r\\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\\r\\n\\u2018If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\\r\\nsuffer!\\u2019 And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\\r\\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\\r\\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\\r\\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\\r\\ntheir clothes. So he said: \\u2018Take care, or I will hang you up again.\\u2019 The\\r\\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\\r\\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: \\u2018If you will not\\r\\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\\u2019 and he hung\\r\\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\\r\\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\\r\\nthe fifty talers, and said: \\u2018Well do you know how to shudder?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019\\r\\nanswered he, \\u2018how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\\r\\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\\r\\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.\\u2019 Then the man saw that he would not\\r\\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \\u2018Such a youth has\\r\\nnever come my way before.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\\r\\nhimself: \\u2018Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\\u2019 A\\r\\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: \\u2018Who are\\r\\nyou?\\u2019 \\u2018I don\\u2019t know,\\u2019 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \\u2018From\\r\\nwhence do you come?\\u2019 \\u2018I know not.\\u2019 \\u2018Who is your father?\\u2019 \\u2018That I may\\r\\nnot tell you.\\u2019 \\u2018What is it that you are always muttering between your\\r\\nteeth?\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\u2019 replied the youth, \\u2018I do so wish I could shudder, but\\r\\nno one can teach me how.\\u2019 \\u2018Enough of your foolish chatter,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nwaggoner. \\u2018Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.\\u2019 The\\r\\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\\r\\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\\r\\nthe youth again said quite loudly: \\u2018If I could but shudder! If I could\\r\\nbut shudder!\\u2019 The host who heard this, laughed and said: \\u2018If that is\\r\\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah,\\r\\nbe silent,\\u2019 said the hostess, \\u2018so many prying persons have already lost\\r\\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\\r\\nthese should never see the daylight again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the youth said: \\u2018However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\\r\\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\\u2019 He let the host have\\r\\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\\r\\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\\r\\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\\r\\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\\r\\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\\r\\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\\r\\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\\r\\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\\r\\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: \\u2018If it be allowed, I will\\r\\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \\u2018You may\\r\\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\\r\\nbe things without life.\\u2019 Then he answered: \\u2018Then I ask for a fire, a\\r\\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\\r\\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\\r\\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\\r\\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \\u2018Ah, if I could\\r\\nbut shudder!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but I shall not learn it here either.\\u2019 Towards\\r\\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\\r\\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: \\u2018Au, miau! how cold we are!\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018You fools!\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\\r\\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\\u2019 And when he had said\\r\\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\\r\\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\\r\\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\\r\\n\\u2018Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\\u2019 \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 he replied, \\u2018but\\r\\njust show me your paws.\\u2019 Then they stretched out their claws. \\u2018Oh,\\u2019 said\\r\\nhe, \\u2018what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.\\u2019\\r\\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\\r\\nand screwed their feet fast. \\u2018I have looked at your fingers,\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\\u2019 and he struck them dead and\\r\\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\\r\\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\\r\\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\\r\\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\\r\\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\\r\\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\\r\\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \\u2018Away with you,\\r\\nvermin,\\u2019 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\\r\\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\\r\\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\\r\\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\\r\\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \\u2018That is the very thing\\r\\nfor me,\\u2019 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\\r\\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\\r\\nthe whole of the castle. \\u2018That\\u2019s right,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but go faster.\\u2019 Then\\r\\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\\r\\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\\r\\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\\r\\nin the air, got out and said: \\u2018Now anyone who likes, may drive,\\u2019 and\\r\\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\\r\\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\\r\\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \\u2018After all it is a\\r\\npity,--for so handsome a man.\\u2019 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \\u2018It\\r\\nhas not come to that yet.\\u2019 Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\\r\\nand asked how he had fared. \\u2018Very well indeed,\\u2019 answered he; \\u2018one\\r\\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.\\u2019 Then he went to the\\r\\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: \\u2018I never expected to\\r\\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 said he,\\r\\n\\u2018it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\\r\\nfire, and once more began his old song: \\u2018If I could but shudder!\\u2019 When\\r\\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\\r\\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\\r\\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\\r\\nchimney and fell before him. \\u2018Hullo!\\u2019 cried he, \\u2018another half belongs\\r\\nto this. This is not enough!\\u2019 Then the uproar began again, there was a\\r\\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. \\u2018Wait,\\u2019 said\\r\\nhe, \\u2018I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.\\u2019 When he had done\\r\\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\\r\\nhideous man was sitting in his place. \\u2018That is no part of our bargain,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the youth, \\u2018the bench is mine.\\u2019 The man wanted to push him away;\\r\\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\\r\\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\\r\\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\\u2019s legs\\r\\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\\r\\nyouth also wanted to play and said: \\u2018Listen you, can I join you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\r\\nif you have any money.\\u2019 \\u2018Money enough,\\u2019 replied he, \\u2018but your balls are\\r\\nnot quite round.\\u2019 Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\\r\\nturned them till they were round. \\u2018There, now they will roll better!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid he. \\u2018Hurrah! now we\\u2019ll have fun!\\u2019 He played with them and lost some\\r\\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\\r\\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\\r\\nto inquire after him. \\u2018How has it fared with you this time?\\u2019 asked he.\\r\\n\\u2018I have been playing at nine-pins,\\u2019 he answered, \\u2018and have lost a couple\\r\\nof farthings.\\u2019 \\u2018Have you not shuddered then?\\u2019 \\u2018What?\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I have\\r\\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\\r\\n\\u2018If I could but shudder.\\u2019 When it grew late, six tall men came in and\\r\\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: \\u2018Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\\r\\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,\\u2019 and he beckoned with his finger,\\r\\nand cried: \\u2018Come, little cousin, come.\\u2019 They placed the coffin on the\\r\\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\\r\\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. \\u2018Wait,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018I\\r\\nwill warm you a little,\\u2019 and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\\r\\nlaid it on the dead man\\u2019s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\\r\\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\\r\\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\\r\\nthought to himself: \\u2018When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\\r\\nother,\\u2019 and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\\r\\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\\r\\nThen said the youth, \\u2018See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?\\u2019 The\\r\\ndead man, however, got up and cried: \\u2018Now will I strangle you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018What!\\u2019 said he, \\u2018is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\\r\\ninto your coffin again,\\u2019 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\\r\\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \\u2018I cannot\\r\\nmanage to shudder,\\u2019 said he. \\u2018I shall never learn it here as long as I\\r\\nlive.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\\r\\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. \\u2018You wretch,\\u2019 cried he,\\r\\n\\u2018you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\\u2019 \\u2018Not so\\r\\nfast,\\u2019 replied the youth. \\u2018If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\\r\\nin it.\\u2019 \\u2018I will soon seize you,\\u2019 said the fiend. \\u2018Softly, softly, do not\\r\\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018We shall see,\\u2019 said the old man. \\u2018If you are stronger, I will let you\\r\\ngo--come, we will try.\\u2019 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\\u2019s\\r\\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\\r\\n\\u2018I can do better than that,\\u2019 said the youth, and went to the other\\r\\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\\r\\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\\r\\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old man\\u2019s beard. \\u2018Now I have you,\\u2019\\r\\nsaid the youth. \\u2018Now it is your turn to die.\\u2019 Then he seized an iron bar\\r\\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\\r\\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\\r\\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\\r\\nthree chests full of gold. \\u2018Of these,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018one part is for the\\r\\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.\\u2019 In the meantime it\\r\\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\\r\\ndarkness. \\u2018I shall still be able to find my way out,\\u2019 said he, and felt\\r\\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\\r\\nNext morning the king came and said: \\u2018Now you must have learnt what\\r\\nshuddering is?\\u2019 \\u2018No,\\u2019 he answered; \\u2018what can it be? My dead cousin was\\r\\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\\r\\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\\u2019 \\u2018Then,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nking, \\u2018you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\\u2019 \\u2018That\\r\\nis all very well,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but still I do not know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\\r\\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\\r\\nsaid always: \\u2018If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.\\u2019 And this\\r\\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \\u2018I will find a cure for him;\\r\\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\\u2019 She went out to the stream\\r\\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\\r\\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\\r\\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\\r\\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\\r\\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \\u2018Oh, what makes me shudder\\r\\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\\r\\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\\r\\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\\r\\nonly made sport of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\\r\\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\\r\\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\\r\\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\\r\\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \\u2018He\\u2019s\\r\\nas round as a tub,\\u2019 said she. The next was too tall: \\u2018What a maypole!\\u2019\\r\\nsaid she. The next was too short: \\u2018What a dumpling!\\u2019 said she. The\\r\\nfourth was too pale, and she called him \\u2018Wallface.\\u2019 The fifth was too\\r\\nred, so she called him \\u2018Coxcomb.\\u2019 The sixth was not straight enough;\\r\\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\\r\\na baker\\u2019s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\\r\\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. \\u2018Look at\\r\\nhim,\\u2019 said she; \\u2018his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\\r\\nGrisly-beard.\\u2019 So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\\r\\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\\r\\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\\r\\ncame to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\\r\\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\\r\\n\\u2018Let him come in.\\u2019 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\\r\\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\\r\\nking said, \\u2018You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\\r\\nyour wife.\\u2019 The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \\u2018I have\\r\\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\\u2019 So words\\r\\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\\r\\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, \\u2018Now get ready to\\r\\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\\r\\nto a great wood. \\u2018Pray,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018whose is this wood?\\u2019 \\u2018It belongs\\r\\nto King Grisly-beard,\\u2019 answered he; \\u2018hadst thou taken him, all had been\\r\\nthine.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\\u2019 sighed she; \\u2018would that I had\\r\\nmarried King Grisly-beard!\\u2019 Next they came to some fine meadows. \\u2018Whose\\r\\nare these beautiful green meadows?\\u2019 said she. \\u2018They belong to King\\r\\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah!\\r\\nunlucky wretch that I am!\\u2019 said she; \\u2018would that I had married King\\r\\nGrisly-beard!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to a great city. \\u2018Whose is this noble city?\\u2019 said she.\\r\\n\\u2018It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\\r\\nthine.\\u2019 \\u2018Ah! wretch that I am!\\u2019 sighed she; \\u2018why did I not marry King\\r\\nGrisly-beard?\\u2019 \\u2018That is no business of mine,\\u2019 said the fiddler: \\u2018why\\r\\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they came to a small cottage. \\u2018What a paltry place!\\u2019 said she;\\r\\n\\u2018to whom does that little dirty hole belong?\\u2019 Then the fiddler said,\\r\\n\\u2018That is your and my house, where we are to live.\\u2019 \\u2018Where are your\\r\\nservants?\\u2019 cried she. \\u2018What do we want with servants?\\u2019 said he; \\u2018you\\r\\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\\r\\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.\\u2019 But the princess knew\\r\\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\\r\\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\\r\\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\\r\\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\\r\\ncottage, the man said, \\u2018Wife, we can\\u2019t go on thus, spending money and\\r\\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.\\u2019 Then he went out and\\r\\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\\r\\nher fingers very sore. \\u2018I see this work won\\u2019t do,\\u2019 said he: \\u2018try and\\r\\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.\\u2019 So she sat down and tried to\\r\\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. \\u2018See\\r\\nnow,\\u2019 said the fiddler, \\u2018you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\\r\\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, I\\u2019ll try and set up a trade in pots\\r\\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.\\u2019 \\u2018Alas!\\u2019\\r\\nsighed she, \\u2018if any of my father\\u2019s court should pass by and see me\\r\\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\\r\\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\\r\\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\\r\\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\\r\\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\\r\\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\\r\\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\\r\\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\\r\\nand knew not what to do. \\u2018Ah! what will become of me?\\u2019 said she; \\u2018what\\r\\nwill my husband say?\\u2019 So she ran home and told him all. \\u2018Who would\\r\\nhave thought you would have been so silly,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018as to put an\\r\\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\\r\\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\\r\\nwork, so I have been to the king\\u2019s palace, and asked if they did not\\r\\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\\r\\nhave plenty to eat.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\\r\\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\\r\\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king\\u2019s eldest son\\r\\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\\r\\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\\r\\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\\r\\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\\r\\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\\u2019s son in golden\\r\\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\\r\\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\\r\\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\\r\\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\\r\\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\\r\\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\\r\\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\\r\\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\\r\\nbrought her back and said, \\u2018Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\\r\\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\\r\\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\\r\\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\\r\\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\\r\\ntime to hold our marriage feast.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\\r\\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\\r\\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\\r\\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\\r\\nand I had been of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIRON HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\\r\\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\\r\\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. \\u2018Perhaps some\\r\\naccident has befallen him,\\u2019 said the king, and the next day he sent out\\r\\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\\r\\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \\u2018Scour\\r\\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\\r\\nthree.\\u2019 But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\\r\\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\\r\\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\\r\\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\\r\\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\\r\\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\\r\\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: \\u2018It is not safe in\\r\\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\\r\\nand you would never come out again.\\u2019 The huntsman replied: \\u2018Lord, I will\\r\\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\\r\\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\\r\\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\\r\\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\\r\\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\\r\\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\\r\\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\\r\\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\\r\\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\\r\\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\\r\\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\\r\\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\\r\\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\\r\\nforest with safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\\r\\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\\r\\nThe boy ran thither and said: \\u2018Give me my ball out.\\u2019 \\u2018Not till you have\\r\\nopened the door for me,\\u2019 answered the man. \\u2018No,\\u2019 said the boy, \\u2018I will\\r\\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,\\u2019 and ran away. The next day he\\r\\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: \\u2018Open my door,\\u2019\\r\\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\\r\\nand the boy went once more and said: \\u2018I cannot open the door even if I\\r\\nwished, for I have not the key.\\u2019 Then the wild man said: \\u2018It lies under\\r\\nyour mother\\u2019s pillow, you can get it there.\\u2019 The boy, who wanted to have\\r\\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\\r\\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\\r\\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\\r\\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: \\u2018Oh,\\r\\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!\\u2019 The wild man turned\\r\\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\\r\\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\\r\\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\\r\\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\\r\\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\\r\\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\\r\\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\\r\\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: \\u2018You will never see your father\\r\\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\\r\\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\\r\\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\\r\\nworld.\\u2019 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\\r\\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: \\u2018Behold, the gold\\r\\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\\r\\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\\r\\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.\\u2019 The boy placed\\r\\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\\r\\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\\r\\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\\r\\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\\r\\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\\r\\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\\r\\nlooked at the boy, and said: \\u2018What has happened to the well?\\u2019 \\u2018Nothing\\r\\nnothing,\\u2019 he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\\r\\nman might not see it. But he said: \\u2018You have dipped your finger into\\r\\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\\r\\nanything go in.\\u2019 By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\\r\\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\\r\\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\\r\\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\\r\\nwhat had happened. \\u2018You have let a hair fall into the well,\\u2019 said he.\\r\\n\\u2018I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\\r\\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\\r\\nme.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\\r\\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\\r\\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\\r\\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\\r\\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\\r\\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\\r\\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\\r\\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\\r\\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\\r\\nalready knew everything, and said: \\u2018Take the handkerchief off.\\u2019 Then the\\r\\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\\r\\nit was of no use. \\u2018You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\\r\\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\\r\\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\\r\\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\\r\\nforest and cry: \\u201cIron Hans,\\u201d and then I will come and help you. My\\r\\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\\r\\nabundance.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king\\u2019s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\\r\\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\\r\\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\\r\\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\\r\\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\\r\\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\\r\\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\\r\\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\\r\\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\\r\\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\\r\\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\\r\\nthe king\\u2019s notice, and he said: \\u2018When you come to the royal table you\\r\\nmust take your hat off.\\u2019 He answered: \\u2018Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\\r\\nsore place on my head.\\u2019 Then the king had the cook called before him\\r\\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\\r\\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\\r\\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener\\u2019s boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\\r\\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\\r\\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\\r\\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\\r\\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\\u2019s daughter, and up she\\r\\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\\r\\nhim: \\u2018Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.\\u2019 He put his cap on with all\\r\\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\\r\\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \\u2018How\\r\\ncan you take the king\\u2019s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\\r\\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\\u2019 \\u2018Oh,\\r\\nno,\\u2019 replied the boy, \\u2018the wild ones have more scent, and will please\\r\\nher better.\\u2019 When he got into the room, the king\\u2019s daughter said: \\u2018Take\\r\\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\\u2019 He again\\r\\nsaid: \\u2018I may not, I have a sore head.\\u2019 She, however, caught at his\\r\\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\\r\\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\\r\\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\\r\\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\\r\\ngardener, and said: \\u2018I present them to your children, they can play with\\r\\nthem.\\u2019 The following day the king\\u2019s daughter again called to him that he\\r\\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\\r\\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\\r\\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\\r\\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\\r\\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\\r\\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\\r\\nmoney.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\\r\\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\\r\\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\\r\\narmy. Then said the gardener\\u2019s boy: \\u2018I am grown up, and will go to the\\r\\nwars also, only give me a horse.\\u2019 The others laughed, and said: \\u2018Seek\\r\\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\\r\\nstable for you.\\u2019 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\\r\\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\\r\\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\\r\\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called \\u2018Iron Hans\\u2019 three\\r\\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\\r\\nappeared immediately, and said: \\u2018What do you desire?\\u2019 \\u2018I want a strong\\r\\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.\\u2019 \\u2018That you shall have, and still more\\r\\nthan you ask for.\\u2019 Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\\r\\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\\r\\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\\r\\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\\r\\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\\r\\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\\r\\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king\\u2019s\\r\\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\\r\\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\\r\\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\\r\\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\\r\\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\\r\\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\\r\\nHans. \\u2018What do you desire?\\u2019 asked the wild man. \\u2018Take back your horse\\r\\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.\\u2019 All that he\\r\\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\\r\\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\\r\\nwished him joy of his victory. \\u2018I am not the one who carried away the\\r\\nvictory,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\\r\\nhis soldiers.\\u2019 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\\r\\nbut the king did not know, and said: \\u2018He followed the enemy, and I did\\r\\nnot see him again.\\u2019 She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\\r\\nhe smiled, and said: \\u2018He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\\r\\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: \\u201cHere comes our\\r\\nhobblety jib back again!\\u201d They asked, too: \\u201cUnder what hedge have you\\r\\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?\\u201d So he said: \\u201cI did the best of all,\\r\\nand it would have gone badly without me.\\u201d And then he was still more\\r\\nridiculed.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king said to his daughter: \\u2018I will proclaim a great feast that shall\\r\\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\\r\\nunknown man will show himself.\\u2019 When the feast was announced, the youth\\r\\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. \\u2018What do you desire?\\u2019\\r\\nasked he. \\u2018That I may catch the king\\u2019s daughter\\u2019s golden apple.\\u2019 \\u2018It is\\r\\nas safe as if you had it already,\\u2019 said Iron Hans. \\u2018You shall likewise\\r\\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\\r\\nchestnut-horse.\\u2019 When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\\r\\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king\\u2019s\\r\\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\\r\\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\\r\\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\\r\\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\\r\\nangry, and said: \\u2018That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\\r\\nhis name.\\u2019 He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\\r\\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\\r\\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\\r\\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\\r\\nwith it, the king\\u2019s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\\r\\nhim that he wounded the youth\\u2019s leg with the point of his sword. The\\r\\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\\r\\nthat the helmet fell from the youth\\u2019s head, and they could see that he\\r\\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the king\\u2019s daughter asked the gardener about his\\r\\nboy. \\u2018He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\\r\\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\\r\\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\\r\\nhis little cap on his head. But the king\\u2019s daughter went up to him and\\r\\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\\r\\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. \\u2018Are you the knight who came\\r\\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\\r\\nthe three golden apples?\\u2019 asked the king. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018and here\\r\\nthe apples are,\\u2019 and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\\r\\nto the king. \\u2018If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\\r\\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\\r\\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.\\u2019 \\u2018If you can perform\\r\\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardener\\u2019s boy; tell me, who is your\\r\\nfather?\\u2019 \\u2018My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\\r\\nas I require.\\u2019 \\u2018I well see,\\u2019 said the king, \\u2018that I owe my thanks to\\r\\nyou; can I do anything to please you?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 answered he, \\u2018that indeed\\r\\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.\\u2019 The maiden laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\u2018He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\\r\\ngolden hair that he was no gardener\\u2019s boy,\\u2019 and then she went and\\r\\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\\r\\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\\r\\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\\r\\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\\r\\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: \\u2018I am\\r\\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\\r\\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT-SKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\\r\\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\\r\\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\\r\\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, \\u2018Promise me that you\\r\\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\\r\\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.\\u2019 Then when the king in his\\r\\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\\r\\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\\r\\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, \\u2018this will not do;\\r\\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.\\u2019 So messengers were\\r\\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\\r\\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\\r\\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\\r\\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\\r\\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\\r\\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\\r\\nhis courtiers, \\u2018May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\\r\\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\\r\\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.\\u2019 When the courtiers heard this\\r\\nthey were shocked, and said, \\u2018Heaven forbid that a father should marry\\r\\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\\u2019 And his daughter\\r\\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\\r\\nso she said to him, \\u2018Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\\r\\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\\r\\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\\r\\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\\r\\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\\u2019 And thus\\r\\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\\r\\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\\r\\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\\r\\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\\r\\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\\r\\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\\r\\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\\r\\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\\r\\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\\r\\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\\r\\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\\r\\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\\r\\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\\r\\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\\r\\non till it was midday.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\\r\\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\\r\\nbark. \\u2018Look sharp!\\u2019 said the king to the huntsmen, \\u2018and see what sort\\r\\nof game lies there.\\u2019 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\\r\\ncame back again said, \\u2018In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\\r\\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\\r\\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.\\u2019 \\u2018See,\\u2019 said the king, \\u2018if\\r\\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.\\u2019 So the huntsmen\\r\\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\\r\\n\\u2018I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\\r\\nme and take me with you.\\u2019 Then they said, \\u2018Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\\r\\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\\r\\nsort.\\u2019 So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king\\u2019s\\r\\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\\r\\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, \\u2018Cat-skin, you may lie and\\r\\nsleep there.\\u2019 And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\\r\\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\\r\\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \\u2018Ah! pretty\\r\\nprincess!\\u2019 thought she, \\u2018what will now become of thee?\\u2019 But it happened\\r\\none day that a feast was to be held in the king\\u2019s castle, so she said to\\r\\nthe cook, \\u2018May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\\r\\ntake care and stand behind the door.\\u2019 And the cook said, \\u2018Yes, you may\\r\\ngo, but be back again in half an hour\\u2019s time, to rake out the ashes.\\u2019\\r\\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\\r\\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\\r\\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\\r\\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\\r\\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\\r\\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a king\\u2019s daughter. But\\r\\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\\r\\nhe thought in his heart, \\u2018I never saw any one half so beautiful.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\\r\\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\\r\\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\\r\\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\\r\\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\\r\\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\\r\\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, \\u2018Let that alone till the morning, and\\r\\nheat the king\\u2019s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\\r\\ntake care you don\\u2019t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\\r\\nnever eating again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\\u2019s soup, and\\r\\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\\r\\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\\r\\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\\r\\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\\r\\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\\r\\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\\r\\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\\r\\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, \\u2018You must have let a hair fall\\r\\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\\u2019 Then he went\\r\\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \\u2018I did,\\u2019\\r\\nanswered the cook. But the king said, \\u2018That is not true; it was better\\r\\ndone than you could do it.\\u2019 Then he answered, \\u2018To tell the truth I did\\r\\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.\\u2019 \\u2018Then let Cat-skin come up,\\u2019 said the\\r\\nking: and when she came he said to her, \\u2018Who are you?\\u2019 \\u2018I am a poor\\r\\nchild,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018that has lost both father and mother.\\u2019 \\u2018How came you\\r\\nin my palace?\\u2019 asked he. \\u2018I am good for nothing,\\u2019 said she, \\u2018but to be\\r\\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.\\u2019 \\u2018But how\\r\\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?\\u2019 asked the king. Then she\\r\\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\\r\\nher away again about her business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\\r\\nher go up and see it as before. \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018but come again in half\\r\\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\\u2019 Then she\\r\\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\\r\\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\\r\\nlooking like a king\\u2019s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\\r\\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\\r\\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\\r\\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\\r\\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\\r\\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\\r\\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\\r\\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\\r\\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\\r\\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\\r\\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\\r\\ntime, it happened just the same as before. \\u2018You must be a witch,\\r\\nCat-skin,\\u2019 said the cook; \\u2018for you always put something into your soup,\\r\\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.\\u2019 However, he let her go up\\r\\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\\r\\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\\r\\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\\r\\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\\r\\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\\r\\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\\r\\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\\r\\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\\r\\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\\r\\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\\r\\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\\r\\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\\u2019s soup; and as soon\\r\\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\\r\\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\\r\\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\\r\\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\\r\\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\\r\\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\\r\\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\\r\\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\\r\\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\\r\\n\\u2018You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\\r\\nother.\\u2019 And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\\r\\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\\r\\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\\r\\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\\r\\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\\r\\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\\r\\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\\r\\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\\r\\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\\r\\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\\r\\nthere was nothing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\\r\\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\\r\\n\\u2018We will not leave each other,\\u2019 Rose-red answered: \\u2018Never so long as we\\r\\nlive,\\u2019 and their mother would add: \\u2018What one has she must share with the\\r\\nother.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\\r\\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\\r\\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\\r\\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\\r\\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\\r\\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\\r\\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\\r\\nworry on their account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\\r\\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\\r\\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\\r\\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\\r\\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\\r\\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\\r\\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\\r\\nwatches over good children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\\u2019s little cottage so neat that\\r\\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\\r\\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\\u2019s\\r\\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\\r\\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\\r\\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\\r\\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \\u2018Go, Snow-white, and\\r\\nbolt the door,\\u2019 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\\r\\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\\r\\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\\r\\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\\r\\nhidden beneath its wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\\r\\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\\r\\n\\u2018Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\\r\\nshelter.\\u2019 Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\\r\\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\\r\\nhead within the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\\r\\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\\u2019s bed. But the bear began\\r\\nto speak and said: \\u2018Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\\r\\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Poor bear,\\u2019 said the mother, \\u2018lie down by the fire, only take care that\\r\\nyou do not burn your coat.\\u2019 Then she cried: \\u2018Snow-white, Rose-red, come\\r\\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\\u2019 So they both came\\r\\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\\r\\nof him. The bear said: \\u2018Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\\r\\nlittle\\u2019; so they brought the broom and swept the bear\\u2019s hide clean;\\r\\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\\r\\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\\r\\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\\r\\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\\r\\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\\r\\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\\r\\nout: \\u2018Leave me alive, children,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\\r\\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\\r\\nbear: \\u2018You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\\r\\nthe cold and the bad weather.\\u2019 As soon as day dawned the two children\\r\\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\\r\\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\\r\\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\\r\\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\\r\\nmorning to Snow-white: \\u2018Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\\r\\nwhole summer.\\u2019 \\u2018Where are you going, then, dear bear?\\u2019 asked Snow-white.\\r\\n\\u2018I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\\r\\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\\r\\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\\r\\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\\r\\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\\r\\ndoes not easily see daylight again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\\r\\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\\r\\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\\r\\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\\r\\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\\r\\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\\r\\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\\r\\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\\r\\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\\r\\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\\r\\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\\r\\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \\u2018Why do you\\r\\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?\\u2019 \\u2018What are you up to,\\r\\nlittle man?\\u2019 asked Rose-red. \\u2018You stupid, prying goose!\\u2019 answered the\\r\\ndwarf: \\u2018I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\\r\\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\\r\\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\\r\\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\\r\\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\\r\\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\\r\\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\\r\\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\\r\\nwas caught too fast. \\u2018I will run and fetch someone,\\u2019 said Rose-red. \\u2018You\\r\\nsenseless goose!\\u2019 snarled the dwarf; \\u2018why should you fetch someone? You\\r\\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\\u2019\\r\\n\\u2018Don\\u2019t be impatient,\\u2019 said Snow-white, \\u2018I will help you,\\u2019 and she pulled\\r\\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\\r\\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\\r\\nup, grumbling to himself: \\u2018Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\\r\\nbeard. Bad luck to you!\\u2019 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\\r\\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\\r\\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\\r\\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\\r\\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \\u2018Where are you going?\\u2019 said\\r\\nRose-red; \\u2018you surely don\\u2019t want to go into the water?\\u2019 \\u2018I am not such\\r\\na fool!\\u2019 cried the dwarf; \\u2018don\\u2019t you see that the accursed fish wants\\r\\nto pull me in?\\u2019 The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\\r\\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\\r\\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\\r\\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\\r\\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\\r\\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\\r\\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\\r\\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\\r\\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\\r\\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\\r\\nhe screamed out: \\u2018Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\\u2019s\\r\\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\\r\\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\\r\\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\\u2019 Then he took\\r\\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\\r\\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\\r\\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\\r\\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\\r\\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\\r\\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\\r\\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\\r\\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\\r\\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\\r\\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\\r\\nwith his shrill voice: \\u2018Could you not have done it more carefully! You\\r\\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\\r\\nclumsy creatures!\\u2019 Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\\r\\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\\r\\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\\r\\nbusiness in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\\r\\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\\r\\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\\r\\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\\r\\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\\r\\nat them. \\u2018Why do you stand gaping there?\\u2019 cried the dwarf, and his\\r\\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\\r\\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\\r\\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\\r\\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\\r\\nhe cried: \\u2018Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\\r\\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\\r\\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\\r\\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\\r\\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy\\u2019s sake eat them!\\u2019 The\\r\\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\\r\\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: \\u2018Snow-white and\\r\\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\\u2019 Then they\\r\\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\\r\\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\\r\\ngold. \\u2018I am a king\\u2019s son,\\u2019 he said, \\u2018and I was bewitched by that wicked\\r\\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\\r\\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\\r\\nwell-deserved punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\\r\\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\\r\\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\\r\\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\\r\\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\\r\\nroses, white and red.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*****\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born\\r\\nin Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout\\r\\ntheir lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\\r\\nUniversity. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,\\r\\nand although Wilhelm\\u2019s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\\r\\ncollaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\\r\\na century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\\r\\nfor the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\\r\\nsources and published in two volumes of \\u2018Nursery and Household Tales\\u2019 in\\r\\n1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\\r\\npart of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\\r\\nfirst published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\\r\\ncame into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\\r\\nTaylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\\r\\nfifty stories \\u2018with the amusement of some young friends principally in\\r\\nview.\\u2019 They have been an essential ingredient of children\\u2019s reading ever\\r\\nsince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS\\u2019 FAIRY TALES ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

This\\r\\nWitch, who lives underneath the heaps of sand at the ocean's edge,\\r\\nwhere, in the summertime, you dig with your shovel, is not at all like\\r\\nother witches. She never rides on a broomstick, and she never goes down\\r\\nchimneys. In the first place there are no broomsticks or chimneys on\\r\\nthe beach at the sea-shore, and in the second place she would not know\\r\\nhow to ride on a broomstick or climb down a chimney, if there were. All\\r\\nthe Sand Witch knows how to do is to sink into the sand when anything\\r\\nscares her, and to come up through the sand when she sees a chance to\\r\\nget acquainted with a person she never was acquainted with before. So\\r\\nnow you know what a Sand Witch is. And if Junior Jenks, seven years\\r\\nold, and dreadfully sunburnt, had known what you know, he would have\\r\\nbeen much better prepared to face the one that came up right under his\\r\\nnose all of a sudden one hot July morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunior was supposed to be in bathing. His mother, and his father, and\\r\\nhis sister were in among the breakers having a fine time, but Junior,\\r\\nalthough he was wearing a bathing suit just like they were, preferred\\r\\nthe good old sandy, sunny beach where foam-crested waves could not\\r\\ntumble you over and over, and fill your mouth with salt water when\\r\\nyou yelled. He had tried bathing once, and no amount of coaxing could\\r\\ninduce him to try it again, so his folks left him to play by himself\\r\\nwhile they took their dip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Junior knew about the Sand Witch was when the tip end of a\\r\\nsteeple hat began to come up through the sand in front of him. Up, up\\r\\nit came until the whole hat was showing; then followed a long nose, two\\r\\nbig, black eyes, a big mouth, and a sharp pointed chin; after that the\\r\\nrest of the Sand Witch followed very quickly, until at last she stood\\r\\nbefore him as cool as a cucumber.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said, not paying the slightest attention to the way\\r\\nJunior's hair was standing up, \\\"here I am. I've heard you digging for\\r\\nsome days. I suppose you thought you'd never find me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Find you?\\\" said Junior, staring with all his might. \\\"I wasn't trying\\r\\nto find you. I never knew there was such a person. I wasn't trying to\\r\\nfind anything.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You weren't?\\\" said the Sand Witch. \\\"Then what in the name of peace\\r\\nwere you digging for?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why,\\\" said Junior, \\\"I--I--I was just digging for fun.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Witch, \\\"did you find any fun?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Find any fun? Of course not! You don't find fun, you--you just have\\r\\nit.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sand Witch pushed her hat on one side and scratched her head in\\r\\nperplexity. \\\"I don't think I understand. You said you were digging for\\r\\nfun, didn't you? And when I asked if you found any fun you say you\\r\\ndon't find fun, you just have it. Well, if you have it, what do you\\r\\ndig for? Tell me that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though she waited very politely for Junior to tell her, he made no\\r\\nanswer. He just looked at her with his mouth open, and wiggled his bare\\r\\ntoes deeper into the sand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My goodness,\\\" said the Witch, at last, \\\"are you deaf? I asked you a\\r\\nquestion.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I--I know,\\\" said the boy, \\\"but--but I can't tell you. I--I don't know\\r\\nhow.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Suffering sea serpents!\\\" exclaimed the newcomer. \\\"You certainly are\\r\\nthe queerest _I_ ever met!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No queerer than you are,\\\" responded Junior, indignantly. \\\"You're the\\r\\nqueerest person _I_ ever met! Coming up through the sand in such a way!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Humph!\\\" retorted the Witch. \\\"How else _could_ I come up? There's\\r\\nnothing else here but sand to _come_ up through. You can't blame that\\r\\non me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, I'm not blaming you,\\\" said Junior. \\\"I'm only telling you. I don't\\r\\nsuppose it is your fault that all this sand is here. It only seemed so\\r\\nstrange for a person to be underneath it. You don't live there, do you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I certainly do!\\\" replied the other; \\\"and all my family, too.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Underneath the sand? Why, I never heard of such a thing! I--I can't\\r\\nbelieve it!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now look here,\\\" said the Sand Witch. \\\"I won't let anybody talk _that_\\r\\nway to me. If you don't believe I live underneath the sand come on down\\r\\nand see for yourself. Just hold your nose tight with the fingers of\\r\\nyour _right_ hand, put your _left_ hand above your head, draw _in_ a\\r\\ndeep breath; and down you go, like this.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThrusting a hand above her head, and grasping her nose, she took a deep\\r\\nbreath, and zip--she sank through the sand like a flash, just the way\\r\\nJunior's father always sank into the ocean when he was bathing. Then\\r\\nbing--the next moment she popped up again, smiling cheerfully. \\\"See how\\r\\neasy it is? Come on, now you try it!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, thank you,\\\" said Junior. \\\"I'd rather stay on _top_ of the sand.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, pshaw!\\\" exclaimed the Sand Witch, \\\"I never saw such a 'fraid cat!\\r\\nYou're not only afraid to take a sea bath, but you don't even dare to\\r\\ntake a sand bath. I'd be ashamed!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, be ashamed, if you want!\\\" said Junior, hotly. \\\"I don't care! I\\r\\ndon't like baths of any kind; in the ocean, or in the sand; or even in\\r\\nthe bathtub. What's the use of them, anyway?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he started digging again. And then it was that the Sand\\r\\nWitch showed what a thoroughly sociable nature she had, for although\\r\\nthe boy had turned his back to her and was paying no attention, she\\r\\nwasn't in the least discouraged. \\\"Did you ever see a crab wait on the\\r\\ntable?\\\" she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why, no,\\\" said Junior, whirling about and looking very much\\r\\ninterested. \\\"I thought all a crab could do was to pinch you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not at all! They wait on the table fine if you let 'em. And I've\\r\\ngot a shooting starfish, too, that can't be beat. You come on down\\r\\nunderneath the sand, and I'll show you. Oh, I've got dozens of\\r\\ndelightful things down there. Why, the sand pies I make are the most\\r\\ndelicious things you ever tasted. And I know you'll laugh when you see\\r\\nthe clams skip rope.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you may be sure all this sounded very, _very_ good to Junior. He\\r\\nhad often heard of starfish, but never of shooting starfish. A crab\\r\\nwaiting on the table was bound to be interesting; and a clam skipping\\r\\nrope, even more so. As for sand pies, he had often made them himself,\\r\\nbut never so they could be eaten. If there was a way to do the trick,\\r\\nhe'd like to know it. In fact, it was like being promised a free ticket\\r\\nto the circus. So throwing his bucket and shovel aside he got to his\\r\\nfeet without further parley.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll go with you. But I've got to be back in\\r\\na half hour. My father is going to take me sailing as soon as he is\\r\\nthrough with his bath.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's all right,\\\" said the Sand Witch. \\\"When you're ready to go\\r\\nback, you just go back. And now do just as I do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Junior held his nose tight, put his other hand above his head, took\\r\\na deep breath, and then bing--he and the Sand Witch sank through the\\r\\nsand in a jiffy, and the next moment came out underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: So Junior held his nose tight]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" cried the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll about was a beautiful, white, glistening, sandy city; houses,\\r\\nfences, streets, all of sand. The place where they were standing seemed\\r\\nto be a sort of park with cute, little, carved, sandy benches amid the\\r\\nsand grass, and several tall fountains spouting sand in a fine spray.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, how do you like it?\\\" asked the Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Fine!\\\" said Junior; \\\"but where are the clams and the--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My goodness,\\\" said the Witch, \\\"but you _are_ in a hurry. I've got to\\r\\nfind my children, first. You don't expect me to neglect my children\\r\\nthat way, do you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" replied the boy, \\\"of course not. But--but I didn't come\\r\\nhere to see your children, you know. I can see children anywhere.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not children like mine,\\\" said the Sand Witch, proudly. \\\"If there is a\\r\\nmore beautiful child than little Lettuce Sand Witch I'd like to see it.\\r\\nAnd as for dear little Ham Sand Witch, he is the _cutest_ thing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ham Sand Witch! Lettuce Sand Witch!\\\" exclaimed Junior. \\\"Are those the\\r\\nnames of your children? Why--why, it sounds like things to eat!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch, \\\"why not? Both of them are certainly\\r\\nsweet enough to eat.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that she opened her mouth and gave a piercing yell. \\\"Children!\\\"\\r\\nshe shrieked. \\\"Come to mother, quick! I've got a little boy for you to\\r\\nplay with!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd presently, racing across the park toward them came the two little\\r\\nSand Witches, one a girl and the other a boy. But though their mother\\r\\nthought them sweet enough to eat, Junior did not. Both had long,\\r\\npointed noses and chins; big, black eyes and dreadfully wide mouths,\\r\\njust like Mrs. Sand Witch. When they saw Junior they just stood and\\r\\nstared, and gnashed their teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hello!\\\" said Ham Sand Witch, after a moment. \\\"Who are you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said his sister, Lettuce Sand Witch, walking about and examining\\r\\nJunior from all sides, \\\"who are you, and where did you come from?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm Junior Jenks,\\\" replied Junior, \\\"and I came from the beach up above\\r\\nto see the clams skip rope.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Pooh!\\\" said Ham Sand Witch. \\\"That's no fun! We're not going to play\\r\\nwith them any more. They want you to turn the rope all the time. If you\\r\\ndon't, they nip you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Junior, \\\"if I can't see the clams skip rope, let me see\\r\\nthe starfish shoot.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Lettuce Sand Witch, \\\"we don't mind. But you'll have\\r\\nto pay his fare if you want to see him shoot.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Pay his fare?\\\" responded Junior. \\\"I don't know what you mean.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ahem!\\\" put in Mrs. Sand Witch. \\\"Perhaps you thought he shot with a\\r\\ngun. Well, he doesn't. He chutes with a chute! And you know as well as\\r\\nI do, you've got to pay your fare when you chute with a chute.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried Junior, in dismay, \\\"I see. But--but I haven't any money.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch, \\\"if you want to see him chute, we'll have\\r\\nto charge it to your father. How about it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the boy, \\\"I guess he won't mind, as long as I never saw a\\r\\nfish chute before.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Mrs. Sand Witch took the children to the chute the chutes on the\\r\\nother side of the park, and told the proprietor, a very shaky old\\r\\njellyfish, that Junior would pay the starfish's fare, and to kindly\\r\\ncoax him out of the ocean to take a ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the jellyfish went to the ocean, which was just back of the chute\\r\\nthe chutes, and yelled for the starfish to hurry up if he wanted a free\\r\\nride. And the starfish, highly flattered at the invitation, lost no\\r\\ntime in making his appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm awfully obliged to you,\\\" he said to Junior, as he whirled about in\\r\\nthe sand to dry himself. \\\"And to show I am I'll let you sit with me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Junior and the starfish, and Ham Sand Witch, and Lettuce Sand Witch,\\r\\nclimbed into the car and went shooting around the chute the chutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Isn't it great?\\\" shrieked the starfish, as they scooted down the\\r\\ninclines. \\\"It makes your insides turn somersaults! It beats swimming\\r\\nall hollow, _I_ think. If ever I get rich I'm going to build one of\\r\\nthese things in the ocean.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when at last the ride came to an end he insisted on Junior shaking\\r\\nhands with every one of his five points. \\\"Any time you fall overboard\\r\\nwhen you're out sailing,\\\" he said, \\\"stop in and see me. My place is the\\r\\nthird clump of coral just beyond the bathing grounds. Good-by!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch, who had waited while the children and the\\r\\nstarfish took their ride, \\\"I've got to go home and get dinner. You\\r\\nchildren amuse yourselves, and after dinner maybe I'll take you to see\\r\\nthe mermaids.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Junior, and Ham Sand Witch, and Lettuce Sand Witch, wandered about\\r\\nthe park hand in hand. Although the little Sand Witches were so ugly,\\r\\nJunior was beginning to like them right well, now that he was getting\\r\\nused to them; and they seemed to like him, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why don't you stay all summer?\\\" said Ham Sand Witch. \\\"We could have\\r\\nlots of fun.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'd like to,\\\" said Junior, \\\"if my father and mother and sister were\\r\\nhere.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, why not ask 'em to come down?\\\" suggested Lettuce Sand Witch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, they wouldn't do it,\\\" said the boy. \\\"I know they wouldn't. They\\r\\nlike it better on the boardwalk and at the hotel. And now let's see if\\r\\nwe can't find those clams that skip rope.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Ham Sand Witch, \\\"but if we do, they'll make you turn\\r\\nfor 'em _just so_. They're awfully snappish.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure enough when presently they came upon the clams sitting on a\\r\\nbench near one of the fountains, and Junior asked if they would skip\\r\\nrope for him, they said they would if he turned for them _just so_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't know what you mean by 'just so,'\\\" said Junior, \\\"but I'll do my\\r\\nbest.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he certainly did do the best he could. While Ham Sand Witch held\\r\\none end of the rope he turned it very, _very_ carefully as the two big,\\r\\nwhite clams solemnly skipped. They were slow enough until they got\\r\\nwarmed up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now give us butter and eggs,\\\" said one of the clams, suddenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Butter and eggs?\\\" said Junior. \\\"You mean pepper and salt, don't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I certainly do _not_,\\\" said the clam who had spoken. \\\"I mean\\r\\nbutter and eggs. Pepper and salt is _fast_, but butter and eggs is\\r\\n_lightning_; and see that you do it right.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though Junior turned the rope with all his might and main he simply\\r\\ncould not turn it fast enough to suit the clams. And presently with a\\r\\nscream of rage they rushed at him snapping their shells angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Run! Run!\\\" shrieked Lettuce Sand Witch, \\\"or they'll nip you!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Run! Run!\\\" yelled Ham Sand Witch. \\\"They pinch awful.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd maybe Junior did not run. And maybe the clams did not run after\\r\\nhim. But luckily, just as they were about to grab him, one of them\\r\\ntripped and fell and cracked its shell, and wept so when it did, that\\r\\nthe other clam stopped to help it. So Junior, and Ham Sand Witch, and\\r\\nLettuce Sand Witch finally reached Mrs. Sand Witch's house and were\\r\\nsoon safe indoors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sakes alive!\\\" exclaimed Mrs. Sand Witch, as the children stood before\\r\\nher, panting. \\\"What has happened?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after they had told her she said they were never even to _speak_\\r\\nto those clams again. \\\"I never did care for clams, anyhow,\\\" she said.\\r\\n\\\"They're always disagreeing with people.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told them that dinner was almost ready and that she knew they\\r\\nwould enjoy it. \\\"We've got the most delicious sandpaper garnished with\\r\\nseaweed,\\\" she added; \\\"to say nothing of sand pies for dessert.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she said that both the little Sand Witches jumped up and\\r\\ndown with glee, and cheered and cheered. \\\"Oh, goody!\\\" they cried. And\\r\\nJunior, being a very polite little boy, cheered also, although he felt\\r\\nquite sure that while he might like the sand pies, he never, _never_\\r\\nwould care for sandpaper garnished with seaweed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then as he sat in the parlor waiting for dinner to be served, he\\r\\nheard a clatter of dishes in the next room, and peeping in, gave a gasp\\r\\nof astonishment, for there was a big, green-backed crab putting the\\r\\ndinner on the table, singing cheerfully to itself as it did so. And\\r\\nthis is what it sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n    'Twas a beautiful day at the bottom of the bay\\r\\n      In the mud where I always dwell,\\r\\n    But being a crab I longed to grab\\r\\n      At the bathers and make 'em yell.\\r\\n    So I took a swim to the water's rim\\r\\n      And looked about for a toe;\\r\\n    And then as I looked some fellow hooked\\r\\n      Me out of the water-o.\\r\\n    He hooked me into a great, big boat\\r\\n      With a piercing yell of joy,\\r\\n    And I do declare I'd still be there\\r\\n      Except for his little boy.\\r\\n    But that blessed lad unlike his dad,\\r\\n      With fright he simply roared--\\r\\n    He gave one squeal as I pinched his heel,\\r\\n      And kicked me overboard.\\r\\n    And now the aim of my humble life\\r\\n      Is to find that boy some way,\\r\\n    And to thank him quick for the kindly kick\\r\\n      That saved my life that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as the crab sang a funny feeling came over Junior. Only a week or\\r\\nso before _he_ had been out with his father in a boat, and _his_ father\\r\\nhad caught a crab on his fishing line, and pulled it into the boat. And\\r\\nJunior, being in his bare feet, had been awfully scared for fear the\\r\\ncrab would pinch him, and then, sure enough, before he could get his\\r\\nfeet up on the seat, it did, right on the heel; and in trying to kick\\r\\nit loose, he kicked it overboard. He wondered if this could possibly be\\r\\nthe same crab.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when they all went in to dinner he looked at the crab carefully to\\r\\nsee if he could recognize it, but as one crab looks like another,\\r\\nhe couldn't be sure. But the minute the crab saw _him_, it was very\\r\\ndifferent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" gasped the creature he had been observing, staggering backward\\r\\nand almost dropping the dish of sandpaper and seaweed it was carrying.\\r\\nThen, putting the dish carefully on the table, it bent over and looked\\r\\nJunior in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"'Tis he!\\\" it shrieked, with a dramatic gesture. \\\"'Tis he! my rescuer!\\\"\\r\\nAnd if Junior had not leaped from his seat it would have thrown its\\r\\nclaws about his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"'Tis he?\\\" exclaimed Mrs. Sand Witch, frowning at her amphibian\\r\\nservant. \\\"What do you mean by ''tis he'? What are you talking about?\\r\\nThis is a nice way to behave before company.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after the creature had explained matters, Mrs. Sand Witch and the\\r\\nlittle Sand Witches were even more excited than the crab was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My, my, how romantic!\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch; \\\"and how lucky it is,\\r\\nBertha, that you're a lady crab. _Now_ you can marry him!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh!\\\" exclaimed Bertha, the crab, trembling violently. \\\"I never thought\\r\\nof that! I'd just love to, if only to show my gratitude. But--but maybe\\r\\nhe wouldn't care to marry me. Would you?\\\" she asked, turning to Junior,\\r\\nwho had once more resumed his seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Marry you?\\\" said the boy, wishing he hadn't sat down again. \\\"Why--why,\\r\\nof course not. Why--why--I--I--why, I'm only a boy. I--I, my mother\\r\\nwouldn't let me get married. I know she wouldn't.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, bother your mother!\\\" retorted the crab, crossly. \\\"She'll never\\r\\nknow anything about it. We'll get married and settle down here, and\\r\\nshe'll never know where you are. And now, when shall it be?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never!\\\" shouted Junior, springing up once more. \\\"I'll never do it.\\r\\nBoys never marry crabs. Boys never marry anybody!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never marry anybody?\\\" put in Mrs. Sand Witch. \\\"Dear me, then how do\\r\\nthey ever get married?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"They don't _get_ married,\\\" said Junior. \\\"They--they just play.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" responded the crab, \\\"you can play. I won't mind. You needn't\\r\\nstop playing just because you're married to me. No, sir-ee!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Junior shook his head. \\\"I'm very sorry,\\\" he said, \\\"but I can't do\\r\\nit.\\\" And though the crab kept on coaxing and coaxing, he wouldn't give\\r\\nin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now look here,\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch, \\\"if we keep this up the dinner\\r\\nwill be cold. So run along, Bertha, and maybe after Junior has had a\\r\\ngood dinner he will change his mind.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, I won't,\\\" said Junior. \\\"And what is more I want to go back to the\\r\\nbeach right off. I told you I was going sailing with my father in a\\r\\nhalf hour.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" replied Mrs. Sand Witch, as she smacked her lips over the last\\r\\nof her sandpaper, \\\"that was before you were engaged to be married.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm not engaged to be married,\\\" stormed the boy; \\\"and if I had known\\r\\nyou were this kind of a person I'd never have come down here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now, now,\\\" said Mrs. Sand Witch, \\\"I'm every bit as old as your\\r\\nmother, and I know what is best for you. You wouldn't like me to spank\\r\\nyou, would you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she said that, Junior decided he might as well give himself up\\r\\nfor lost. Soon as a person began to say she knew what was best for you,\\r\\nyou might as well make up your mind, you are done for. \\\"Good gracious!\\\"\\r\\nhe said to himself, \\\"whatever shall I do?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when dinner was over, and he went into the park again with the\\r\\nlittle Sand Witches, he was so depressed he wouldn't play or do\\r\\nanything; and finally, Ham Sand Witch got tired trying to cheer him up\\r\\nand went off to play with some other sand witches, leaving Junior and\\r\\nLettuce Sand Witch sitting on a bench side by side.\\r\\n\\r\\nLettuce Sand Witch, swinging her legs violently, was looking at him.\\r\\nThen she slid along the bench and snuggled up close. \\\"I'm awfully\\r\\nsorry,\\\" she said. \\\"And I think it's dreadfully mean to make you marry\\r\\nBertha. She's not pretty like I am, is she? Wouldn't you rather marry\\r\\nme?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the minute she said that, Junior had a bright idea. He didn't\\r\\nwant to marry Lettuce Sand Witch any more than he wanted to marry the\\r\\ngrateful Bertha, one was as ugly as the other; but maybe if he let on\\r\\nhe wanted to, she might tell him how to get back to the beach. So he\\r\\nsnuggled up to her when she snuggled up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Maybe I would,\\\" he said, smiling at her. \\\"But I couldn't possibly do\\r\\nit until I asked my mother. You tell me how to get back to the beach,\\r\\nand if my mother says I can marry you, I'll come right back and do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, will you, really?\\\" cried Lettuce Sand Witch, springing to her feet\\r\\nand clapping her hands. \\\"Then I'll tell you how to get to the beach,\\r\\nor at least the way my mother gets there. She stands up straight like\\r\\nthis; holds her nose with her _left_ hand and puts her _right_ hand\\r\\nabove her head; then she blows _out_ her breath instead of drawing it\\r\\nin; and up she goes. And now, you won't forget to come back?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" said Junior, \\\"I'll do just as I promised. If my mother\\r\\ntells me to come back and marry you, I'll do it. And now, good-by, and\\r\\nthank you very, _very_ much.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant he stood up as straight as he could, grasped his nose\\r\\nwith his left hand, put his right hand above his head, blew out his\\r\\nbreath, and bing--he shot up through the sand, and found himself right\\r\\nalongside of his bucket and shovel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked about. Everything was just the same. The sun was shining,\\r\\npeople were still in bathing, but nowhere among them could he see his\\r\\nfather, or mother, or sister. And then, presently they came tearing\\r\\nover the sand toward him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You bad boy!\\\" scolded Mrs. Jenks. \\\"Where have you been? We've been\\r\\nterribly worried! How dare you go off by yourself? Where were you, I\\r\\nsay?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why--\\\" began Junior.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he stopped. What was the use? He knew they wouldn't believe him.\\r\\nAnd if he asked his mother if he could go back and marry Lettuce Sand\\r\\nWitch as he promised he would ask her, she would say he was sick or\\r\\nsomething, and make him go to bed. So he just dug his toes into the\\r\\nsand and said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that is why poor little Lettuce Sand Witch is still waiting\\r\\nunderneath the sand for Junior Jenks to come marry her. And that is why\\r\\nJunior Jenks keeps looking about so queerly when he plays on the beach\\r\\nby himself. He is taking no chances of another sociable sand witch\\r\\npopping up in his neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                        THE FOUNTAIN OF RICHES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter what other mistakes you may make in your lifetime, never make\\r\\nthe mistake of renting a cottage from an ogre. If you do, the chances\\r\\nare you will bitterly regret it, as did Hak, the aged woodcutter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHak, was an old, old man who lived in a forest with his little\\r\\ngrandson, Omo, whose father and mother were dead; and who earned his\\r\\nliving by cutting down trees and chopping them into firewood. The\\r\\ncottage that Hak and his grandson lived in belonged to an ogre, and the\\r\\nrent the old man paid for it was not very much; and as long as he kept\\r\\nhis health and strength, he got along very nicely. But one day, while\\r\\ncutting down a tree he tripped and fell, and before he could get out of\\r\\nthe way the falling tree struck him and broke his leg. And after Omo\\r\\nhad dragged him back into the cottage all he could do was to lie on\\r\\nhis bed and groan, and wait for the leg to get well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Goodness gracious!\\\" he said to the boy, \\\"What _shall_ we do? I won't\\r\\nbe able to work for days and days, and there will be the rent to pay,\\r\\nto say nothing of the doctor's bill.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Omo, \\\"the rent and the doctor's bill will have to wait. So\\r\\ndon't worry.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I have to worry,\\\" replied the old man. \\\"The doctor may wait for _his_\\r\\nbill, but the person who owns this cottage will not wait for his rent;\\r\\nno sir-ee.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told Omo that the cottage belonged to an ogre. \\\"He let me have\\r\\nit very cheap, but only for a certain reason. What do you think that\\r\\nreason was?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" replied Omo. \\\"What was it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That he should be allowed to make you into a dumpling for dessert if I\\r\\ndid not pay the rent every month without fail.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Omo, his eyes very big. \\\"I don't wonder you are worried.\\r\\nIt--it makes me feel worried, too! Why did you ever make such a\\r\\nbargain?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said his grandfather, groaning worse than ever, \\\"I never\\r\\nthought for a minute that I would ever have my leg broken, and I was so\\r\\nvery, _very_ poor I simply _had_ to have a cottage _cheap_. But now,\\r\\nI'll not only lose the cottage, but you also. I guess I might as well\\r\\ndie.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Don't you do it!\\\" responded Omo. \\\"I haven't been made into a dumpling\\r\\n_yet_, and I'm not going to be, if I can help it. I'll go into the city\\r\\nand get the doctor, and while I'm there I'll try to earn enough money\\r\\nto pay the rent.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Omo's grandfather only shook his head. \\\"You're a plucky boy, Omo,\\\"\\r\\nhe said, \\\"but you'll never be able to do it. How can a boy of seven\\r\\nearn anything?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, I can try, can't I?\\\" said Omo. \\\"You can't do anything if you\\r\\ndon't try.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo pulling his cap down over his curls, and tucking some bread and\\r\\ncheese into his pocket, he set off for town. But when he arrived at\\r\\nthe doctor's office he found that the waiting room was crowded with\\r\\npeople, and that he would have to wait his turn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" he sighed, as he sat down next to a little old lady with a\\r\\nfrilled bonnet on her head, \\\"this is most unfortunate. My grandfather\\r\\nought to be attended to right away.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, he won't get attended to right away,\\\" said the old lady, \\\"I can\\r\\ntell you that! This doctor charges by the length of time you wait in\\r\\nhis office, so he _never_ hurries. I've been here three months.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Three months!\\\" cried the boy. \\\"Oh, I couldn't possibly wait three\\r\\nmonths, or even three days. I'm in a hurry! I've got to earn enough\\r\\nmoney to pay the rent of our cottage, or the ogre who owns it will turn\\r\\nme into a dumpling and eat me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he said that everybody in the waiting room twisted about and\\r\\nlooked at him. \\\"He seems to have a fever,\\\" they said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"See here,\\\" said the old lady, \\\"are you sure you're not sick instead of\\r\\nyour grandfather?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm _perfectly_ well!\\\" exclaimed Omo, indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then you must be joking,\\\" responded the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, I'm not,\\\" said Omo. \\\"I mean every word I said. I'm in great\\r\\ntrouble.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"H'm,\\\" said the old lady. She got to her feet. \\\"Come on, let's go\\r\\noutside! We'll save money by it anyway!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen as they walked along the street Omo told her all about his\\r\\ngrandfather's accident, and how important it was that the rent should\\r\\nbe paid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ha!\\\" exclaimed the old lady. \\\"I know that ogre! His name is Gub and he\\r\\nlives on the hill on the other side of the city. I often used to help\\r\\npeople out of his clutches. I'm a retired fairy godmother--haven't been\\r\\nin business for years and years--but your story interests me. I've a\\r\\ngood mind to help you!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, if you only would!\\\" said Omo, \\\"I'd be awfully obliged. You\\r\\nsee, it's not very pleasant to be made into a dumpling, and have my\\r\\ngrandfather put out of his cottage when he has a broken leg. Please,\\r\\n_please_, help me!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the old lady, as she led the way into a little house with\\r\\na peaked roof, \\\"I only help people who help themselves. Can you help\\r\\nyourself?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Certainly!\\\" said Omo. \\\"Just offer me something and watch me help\\r\\nmyself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well then, I will,\\\" responded the fairy godmother. Going to a\\r\\ngolden desk in a corner she took from it a silver key. \\\"This is the key\\r\\nthat turns on the Fountain of Riches in the City of Ootch. All you have\\r\\nto do is to put the key in the keyhole at the base of the fountain,\\r\\ngive three turns to the right, three turns to the left, and _one_ turn\\r\\nin the middle, and instantly the fountain will commence to spout gold\\r\\npieces enough to bury you. But you must promise me this, be sure and\\r\\nturn the fountain off as soon as you get enough gold pieces to fill\\r\\nyour cap; and be sure and bring the key back to me, for I wouldn't want\\r\\nthat key to be left in Ootch, or that fountain to be left spouting,\\r\\nfor anything.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" asked Omo. \\\"What's the use of a fountain if it doesn't\\r\\nspout?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, you see I presented that fountain to the city of Ootch because\\r\\nthey named the city after my great aunt's trained cockatoo, but after\\r\\nthe fountain started spouting gold pieces everybody had so much money\\r\\nthey all stopped working, and it almost ruined them. The butcher\\r\\nstopped selling meat, and the baker stopped baking bread, and the\\r\\ntailor stopped making clothes. Everybody stopped doing everything, and\\r\\npretty soon, although everybody had plenty of money, you couldn't buy\\r\\nanything because nobody would take the trouble to keep store when they\\r\\ncould get money from the fountain. So I locked the fountain up and took\\r\\nthe key with me. And after the people of Ootch had spent some of the\\r\\nmoney they had, and lost the rest, and could not get any more without\\r\\nworking for it, everything got all right again. And that's the reason\\r\\nI don't want the fountain to keep on spouting again, or want you to\\r\\nleave the key behind you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should think not,\\\" said Omo. \\\"It seems as bad to be too rich as it\\r\\nis to be too poor. I'll be very careful about shutting the fountain\\r\\noff, and I won't forget to bring back the key. And now how do I get to\\r\\nthe city of Ootch?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Just open my back door,\\\" said the fairy godmother, handing him the\\r\\nkey, \\\"step out on the step, and then step off. And I do hope you won't\\r\\nfind it raining, for when it rains in Ootch, it rains cats and dogs.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Omo opened the fairy godmother's back door and stepped out on the\\r\\nstep, and as he stood there all he saw before him was a pretty little\\r\\ngarden. Then, he stepped off the step, and bing--he was in a queer\\r\\nlooking city, and the garden and the back step, and the cottage, and\\r\\nthe fairy godmother, had all disappeared. And in addition it _was_\\r\\nraining cats and dogs; regular, real cats and dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ouch!\\\" cried Omo, as a fat maltese fell ker-plunk on his head, yowling\\r\\nlike anything. \\\"Whee!\\\" he yelled, as a fox terrier dropped with a\\r\\nthud on his shoulder and barked in his ear. And then, as black, white,\\r\\nbrown, yellow cats of every color, and dogs, big, little and medium,\\r\\nbegan pouring on him and around him, all howling, and barking, and\\r\\nspitting at the same time, he made a rush for a small building, open at\\r\\nthe sides but with a dome like roof of metal, where a man was standing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quite a shower, isn't it?\\\" said the man, as Omo reached the shelter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A shower,\\\" gasped Omo, \\\"why--why, I think it's much more than a\\r\\nshower. And--and look what's coming down--cats and dogs!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: It was raining cats and dogs]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the other, \\\"why not? That's what always comes down,\\r\\nisn't it? That is why we build these cat and dog proof pavilions for\\r\\nuse on rainy days. Now if it rained elephants, that _would_ be an\\r\\ninconvenience.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should say so,\\\" replied the boy. \\\"But does it always rain like this?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, sometimes it's a great deal worse. I remember about two years\\r\\nago I was caught in a storm and eight cats, all in one lump, and\\r\\nfighting as hard as they could, fell right on top of me as I crossed\\r\\nthe street, and I assure you, sir, I _almost_ lost my temper.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Omo, \\\"it's lucky they melt as soon as they reach the\\r\\nground or you'd have more cats and dogs than you knew what to do with.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quite true,\\\" responded the stranger, \\\"and even as it is, it is quite a\\r\\nnuisance when a storm comes up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was an odd looking fellow with a curly beard, a scimitar in his\\r\\nsash, and a spotted turban on his head. As he finished speaking he\\r\\nbegan twisting at his ear with his finger as though he were winding a\\r\\nclock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What's the matter,\\\" asked Omo, \\\"is your ear sore?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Certainly not! You know as well as I do I'm only winding myself up so\\r\\nI can start home as soon as the storm passes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried Omo, \\\"is that it? Well, I don't have to wind myself up\\r\\nwhen I want to go anywhere. I'm always wound up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You are!\\\" exclaimed the stranger. \\\"Why, I can hardly believe it! I\\r\\nnever heard of _anyone_ being _that_ way! You can't have lived here\\r\\nvery long.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said the boy, \\\"I haven't lived here a half hour. I only just\\r\\ncame.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he asked his companion if this was the city of Ootch, where the\\r\\nfamous Fountain of Riches was located.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said the stranger, \\\"this is the city of Ootch all right. And\\r\\nthe Fountain of Riches is here, too, but it's turned off; been turned\\r\\noff for years. Gee whiz, don't I remember the good old days when it was\\r\\nturned on. Everybody got so rich we nearly starved to death because\\r\\nnobody would work to provide things for us to live on. And then all\\r\\nof a sudden the fountain stopped, and I had to go to work again. I'm\\r\\na night watchman. Not that there is much use of watching the night,\\r\\nbecause no one ever tries to steal it, but that's the trade my father\\r\\ntaught me, so I'm it. And now, maybe you'll tell me why you ask about\\r\\nthe Fountain of Riches?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Omo, cautiously, \\\"I've heard so much about it I just\\r\\nthought I'd like to see it while I was here.\\\" He didn't think it wise\\r\\nto tell anything about the fairy godmother giving him the key to the\\r\\nfountain for fear some one might try to take the key from him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quite so,\\\" said the other, \\\"then you'd better come with me. The shower\\r\\nis over now, and if you want to see the fountain you've got to get a\\r\\npermit from the Doodab.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The Doodab! What's a Doodab?\\\" asked Omo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A Doodab,\\\" exclaimed the Night Watchman, \\\"is the next swellest person\\r\\nto a Gumshu. Ootch isn't important enough to be governed by a Gumshu\\r\\nso they put a Doodab over us, and he's a right decent chap, and _very_\\r\\nfond of music. Why I've seen him sit by the hour and push a slate\\r\\npencil across a slate and go into ecstasies because it made his blood\\r\\nrun cold. You'll probably like him if you don't hate him. So come along\\r\\nand see for yourself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Doodab of Ootch was a very, very fat, and a very, very lazy\\r\\ngentleman. He hated to be bothered about anything at any time. He wore\\r\\nrings on his fingers and bells on his toes, and he had a big hoop of\\r\\npearls through the end of his nose. And he especially hated to be\\r\\nbothered when he was singing, which is what he was doing as Omo and the\\r\\nNight Watchman entered his apartment. And this is what he was singing\\r\\nin a very quivery voice as he accompanied himself on a slate with an\\r\\nawfully squeaky slate pencil:\\r\\n\\r\\n    The currant cakes were thick upon the bushes;\\r\\n      The pie plants they were swaying in the breeze,\\r\\n    And the river it was made of delicious lemonade.\\r\\n      While the doughnuts all were ripe upon the trees.\\r\\n    We wandered hand in hand about the garden\\r\\n      Where the lollipops were strolling to and fro;\\r\\n    And I always will recall that exciting day in Fall\\r\\n      When we stood and watched the pickled onions grow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" exclaimed the Doodab, fretfully, \\\"what _do_ you want? It seems\\r\\nstrange I can't embark on a sea of melody without being dragged ashore\\r\\nlike this. What _do_ you want?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This boy wants to get a permit to look at the Fountain of Riches,\\\"\\r\\nsaid the Night Watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He wants--What does he want that for?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, I just want to see what it looks like,\\\" said Omo. \\\"I never saw a\\r\\nFountain of Riches before.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hum!\\\" said the Doodab of Ootch. \\\"That remark has a very jarring note\\r\\nin it. And what are you going to do after you've seen the Fountain of\\r\\nRiches?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why,\\\" said Omo, \\\"just--just look at it, of--of course.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And what are you going to do after that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why, just--just keep on looking at it, I guess,\\\" responded the\\r\\nboy, hardly knowing what to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nonsense!\\\" said the Doodab, \\\"it won't do any good to keep on looking\\r\\nat it forever. And besides if you look at it too long the permit will\\r\\nrun out. It only lasts three minutes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Three minutes!\\\" exclaimed Omo. \\\"Oh, I couldn't turn the fountain on\\r\\nand off, and gather up the gold pieces in three minutes.\\\" And then he\\r\\nclapped his hand to his mouth in dismay when he realized what he had\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ah, ha!\\\" said the Doodab of Ootch, rattling the bells on his toes. \\\"So\\r\\nyou're going to turn it on, eh?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, ho!\\\" said the Night Watchman. \\\"And how in the world did you find\\r\\nout how to turn it on?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, I found out!\\\" replied the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Doodab, \\\"I'm mighty glad to hear it, for I'm\\r\\ndreadfully hard up. My purse is just about empty.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he clapped his hands and when his servants entered the room, he\\r\\ntold them to get several large sacks and some shovels, and follow him.\\r\\nThen having twisted his ear and wound himself up, while the Night\\r\\nWatchman did the same, he took Omo by one hand and the Night Watchman\\r\\nby the other, and led the way to the Fountain of Riches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"See here,\\\" said Omo, as they hurried through the streets, \\\"you two\\r\\nneedn't think you're going to have piles of gold pieces again, for\\r\\nyou're not. I'm only going to turn that fountain on long enough to get\\r\\nmy hat full; and then I'm going to turn it off.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What!\\\" shrieked the Doodab of Ootch, \\\"you're going to turn it off\\r\\nbefore I get my sacks full?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Can I believe my ears?\\\" said the Night Watchman. \\\"You can't mean to\\r\\nturn it off before I get my pockets full? Why--why if it hadn't been\\r\\nfor me you never would have seen the Doodab, or found out where the\\r\\nfountain was. You must be spoofing!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, I'm not,\\\" said Omo. \\\"I'm very sorry, but I promised to turn the\\r\\nfountain off the minute I got my hat full.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The minute you get your hat full, eh?\\\" said the Doodab, looking at Omo\\r\\nslyly. Then he whispered in the Night Watchman's ear, after which they\\r\\nboth laughed merrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What are you laughing at?\\\" asked Omo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We're laughing,\\\" said the Night Watchman, \\\"to think how you're going\\r\\nto turn the fountain off after you get your hat full.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time they had reached the Fountain of Riches which was in the\\r\\ncenter of the public square of the city.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Are you still determined to turn it off as soon as you get your hat\\r\\nfull?\\\" asked the Night Watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I have to,\\\" said Omo. \\\"I promised.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Doodab, snappishly, \\\"if you want to shut it off you've\\r\\ngot to turn it on first, haven't you? So go ahead!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Omo took out the silver key, fitted it into the keyhole at the base\\r\\nof the fountain, and turned three times to the right, then three times\\r\\nto the left, and then _three_ times in the middle, and bing--with a\\r\\nclink and a chink, and a tinkle, the fountain of riches began to spout.\\r\\nAnd the minute it did that, the Night Watchman grabbed Omo's cap from\\r\\nhis head, and the Doodab snatched the key from his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There,\\\" said the Doodab of Ootch, hurling the key as far as he could,\\r\\n\\\"I guess you won't turn off the fountain until you find that key.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Night Watchman, hurling Omo's cap as far as _he_ could,\\r\\n\\\"and I guess you won't fill your cap until you find your cap either.\\r\\nAnd by the time you do I'll have my pockets full of gold pieces.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And,\\\" put in the Doodab, \\\"I'll have my sacks full also.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you may be sure Omo was very angry at the trick played on him,\\r\\nand started after the cap and key as quickly as he could. It did not\\r\\ntake him long to find his cap, but he simply could not find the key.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"See here,\\\" he cried, running back to where the Doodab was tying up the\\r\\nnecks of his sacks, which were now filled to bursting, \\\"you've got to\\r\\nhelp me find that key. I promised to turn this fountain off and I'm\\r\\ngoing to do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said the Doodab, \\\"I'll help you. I've got gold enough here\\r\\nto last me the rest of my life so I don't care how soon you turn it\\r\\noff.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nor I,\\\" said the Night Watchman. \\\"I've got all my pockets full, and my\\r\\nstockings full besides, so stop the old thing whenever you want.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Omo, and the Doodab, and the Night Watchman, although they searched\\r\\nand searched, could not find the key anywhere, and all the while the\\r\\nfountain was spouting gold pieces in a stream a hundred feet high, and\\r\\nso thick it looked like smoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My sakes!\\\" said the Doodab of Ootch, \\\"I don't know how you'll ever\\r\\nstop it! I'm sorry I threw the key away now! But, anyhow, the worst\\r\\nthat can happen if the fountain keeps on spouting, is to give the town\\r\\na spell of nervous prosperity.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut alas, the Doodab of Ootch did not know what he was talking about,\\r\\nfor the fountain kept on spouting and spouting, faster and faster; and\\r\\npresently the streets were knee deep in gold pieces. It was awful.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Say,\\\" said the Night Watchman to Omo, \\\"are you sure you turned the\\r\\nfountain on all right? It never spouted like this before. We've always\\r\\nbeen able to pick up the gold pieces as fast as they came out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course I turned it on right,\\\" said the boy. \\\"I turned the key three\\r\\ntimes to the right and three times to the left, and then _once_ in the\\r\\nmiddle.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No such thing!\\\" shrieked the Doodab. \\\"No such thing! You turned it\\r\\n_three_ times in the middle! I watched you!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried Omo, in a horrified tone, \\\"did I? Then--then _that's_ why\\r\\nthe gold is coming out so fast. And it's getting deeper all the time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It'll soon be up to our necks!\\\" cried the Night Watchman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"We are lost!\\\" roared the Doodab. He glared at Omo angrily. \\\"How dared\\r\\nyou turn it on wrong?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, what did you throw the key away for?\\\" retorted the boy. \\\"If you\\r\\nhadn't done that, I could turn it off.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there they stood quarreling, and all the time the gold was getting\\r\\ndeeper and deeper about them. And when at last they decided they had\\r\\nbetter go back to the Doodab's palace before they were buried alive,\\r\\nthey found it was too late. The gold pieces were so deep they could not\\r\\nwalk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Mercy me!\\\" groaned Omo. \\\"I'll never get back to my grandfather now. I\\r\\nwish I had never come here!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So do I!\\\" snapped the Doodab of Ootch. \\\"Until you came I was perfectly\\r\\npoor and happy, and now I'm horribly rich and wretched. Oh, what\\r\\n_shall_ we do?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then all of a sudden Omo remembered a whistle the fairy godmother\\r\\nhad given him when she gave him the key. \\\"If you really need me for\\r\\nanything,\\\" she had said, \\\"just blow this whistle; but not unless you\\r\\n_really_ need me.\\\" So Omo put the whistle to his lips and blew as\\r\\nhard as he could, for he thought if he ever _really_ needed a fairy\\r\\ngodmother he needed one now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the minute he blew the whistle there was a flutter and a whirr, and\\r\\nthe fairy godmother, frilled bonnet and all, stood before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" she said, \\\"you are in a _nice_ mess, aren't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It isn't my fault,\\\" said the boy. And then he told her how he had\\r\\ntried to obey her instructions, but could not because the Doodab of\\r\\nOotch had thrown the key away. \\\"I did make a mistake turning the\\r\\nfountain on,\\\" he said, \\\"but I could have turned it off all right if the\\r\\nkey had not been taken from me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I see!\\\" said the fairy godmother.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told Omo to fill his cap as well as his pockets with gold\\r\\npieces. And after he had done it, she gave three clucks like a chicken\\r\\ndoes, snapped her finger twice; and bing--all the gold pieces in the\\r\\nstreets of Ootch, all the gold in the Doodab's money bags, all the\\r\\ngold in the pockets and stockings of the Night Watchman; all the gold\\r\\neverywhere except that which Omo had, disappeared, and the Fountain of\\r\\nRiches also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There,\\\" she said, \\\"that's the best way to settle the matter. And now,\\r\\ncome on, Omo, and get the doctor for your grandfather and pay the ogre\\r\\nhis rent.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" howled the Doodab of Ootch and the Night Watchman, \\\"what do we\\r\\ndo? We haven't a cent!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You don't deserve any,\\\" replied the fairy godmother, sternly. \\\"And as\\r\\nlong as you're howling so about it, I'll just make you and the whole\\r\\ncity disappear as well.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she did, with three clucks and a snap of her fingers; and the next\\r\\nmoment Omo found himself in the fairy godmother's cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you can easily guess how after thanking his benefactress for\\r\\nwhat she had done, he hurried off to the doctor's office. And when the\\r\\ndoctor saw Omo's cap and pockets full of gold, he went with him at\\r\\nonce; and became so interested in Omo's grandfather's case he took ten\\r\\nyears to cure him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut neither Omo nor his grandfather cared if he did, for they had\\r\\nplenty of money. And when the ogre came stamping in to collect his\\r\\nrent, thinking he would not get it and would then make Omo into a\\r\\ndumpling, Omo just laughed and _bought_ the place from him. And not\\r\\nonly that, but he added another wing to the cottage and laid out a\\r\\npretty garden as well, as much like the fairy godmother's as he could\\r\\nmake it. And when he did that the fairy godmother was so pleased she\\r\\ncame and kept house for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now if you want to see a really _happy_ family, just stop and\\r\\nmake a visit at Omo's place in the middle of the forest where his\\r\\ngrandfather used to cut down the trees to make a living, but which he\\r\\ndoes not have to do any more, thanks to the Fountain of Riches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                            OBSTINATE TOWN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course you know what a postage stamp is: a little, square, gummed\\r\\nstamp with a picture of George Washington on it. But a _magic_ postage\\r\\nstamp is a very different stamp indeed. The George Washington kind you\\r\\ncan buy in the drug stores, but the other sort you cannot buy. They are\\r\\ngiven to you free of charge, if you don't look out.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn, when the leaves are falling, the Poppykoks come to town.\\r\\nThere may be a hundred leaves falling and not one leaf have a Poppykok\\r\\non it, and then all of a sudden, another leaf falls on your shoulder\\r\\nand a Poppykok is sitting on it, and then--bing--the moment he lands on\\r\\nyour shoulder he jumps off the leaf and pastes a magic postage stamp\\r\\non your cheek, and then--off you start for Obstinate Town by special\\r\\ndelivery, that is, you do if you happen to be a boy that always wants\\r\\nhis own way. But if you are not that kind of a boy, you need not worry.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the boy this story is about was one of the kind who wanted his\\r\\nown way. No matter what he was told to do he wanted to do something\\r\\nelse. Otherwise, he was a very nice little chap, and his name was\\r\\nPrince Zep, the only son of a wealthy and powerful king. Of course\\r\\nbeing a prince he was allowed to have his own way much more than was\\r\\ngood for him, and was so used to it, he never thought anything about\\r\\nhow unpleasant it might make things for other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so, it is not surprising that one afternoon late in the Fall he was\\r\\ncaught, and sent off to Obstinate Town by special delivery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Zep never guessed, any more than you have, that there was such a\\r\\nplace as Obstinate Town, or such things as Poppykoks or magic postage\\r\\nstamps. And so, as he strolled through the Royal Park that afternoon\\r\\nscudding his feet through the dried leaves that covered the way, he\\r\\nhad not the slightest idea that anything was going to happen to him,\\r\\nuntil quite unexpectedly, a big, red maple leaf fell on his shoulder,\\r\\nand from it stepped a Poppykok in his bright scarlet coat and breeches,\\r\\nand with his magic postage stamp neatly curled up in a roll in his\\r\\nhand. And before Zep could even gasp, the Poppykok had pasted the stamp\\r\\non his cheek, leaped from his shoulder to the ground, and stood before\\r\\nhim, smiling cheerfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: The Poppykok pasted a magic postage stamp on his cheek]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There you are,\\\" said the Poppykok, \\\"a good job, well done. Bon voyage!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Bon what?\\\" began Zep, \\\"I--I--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's all right,\\\" responded the Poppykok, \\\"you don't know where\\r\\nyou're going, but you're going. Good-by! I'll see you later!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then Zep felt himself leap into the air and start off with a whiz.\\r\\nAnd the more he whizzed, the more he whizzed, until it seemed as though\\r\\nhe would never stop whizzing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My gracious,\\\" he thought, as well as he could as he hurried along,\\r\\n\\\"what on earth has happened to me, and where, oh where, am I going?\\r\\nThis is really dreadful!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed it was for a little while. But presently he began to get\\r\\nused to the whizzing, and finally found himself descending in a\\r\\ngraceful curve before a large and ornate building that looked very much\\r\\nlike a palace. And sure enough that is exactly what it was, and sitting\\r\\non the steps of the palace waiting for him was the very same Poppykok\\r\\nthat had started him off on his journey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Welcome!\\\" said the Poppykok, rising and coming forward as the Prince\\r\\nreached the ground with a bump, \\\"you're right on time. I hope you had a\\r\\npleasant trip?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Zep, crossly, \\\"I certainly did not. I had a horrid trip. How\\r\\ndare you treat me this way?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Pooh! Pooh!\\\" responded the other, snapping his fingers, \\\"everybody\\r\\nsays that when they first arrive. You'll be crazy about the place in a\\r\\nlittle while. And now let's go inside and report to the Emperor.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPushing open the front door of the palace the Poppykok led the way into\\r\\nthe grand entrance hall, and as he did so a short, fat man with a\\r\\ncrown on his bald head, and bristling whiskers all about his face, came\\r\\ntumbling down the stairway head over heels, and landed in a heap at\\r\\ntheir feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ouch!\\\" he exclaimed, sitting up and rubbing his nose. After which\\r\\nhe rubbed his shins and said \\\"ouch\\\" once more; and \\\"oh my\\\" and \\\"good\\r\\ngracious.\\\" And after that he bawled up the stairs as loud as he could:\\r\\n\\\"Don't try to tell _me_ to be careful and not fall downstairs, for I'll\\r\\ndo as I want.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he swung himself about. \\\"The idea,\\\" he said, glaring at the\\r\\nPrince and the Poppykok, \\\"of any one trying to keep _me_ from falling\\r\\ndownstairs. Huh! Can't I fall down my own stairs? Can't I? Tell me!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Certainly you can, your majesty,\\\" responded the Poppykok. \\\"You can\\r\\nfall up 'em, too, if you want.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should think so,\\\" retorted the Emperor, \\\"and yet the Queen tells me\\r\\nto look out and not fall down 'em, because it worries her. Well, let\\r\\nher worry. I want her to worry.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the Queen was worried she did not act that way, for as she\\r\\ncame tripping down she was laughing so heartily that she nearly fell\\r\\nherself, and finally had to sit on the bottom step to get her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What--what--\\\" spluttered the Emperor, \\\"what do you mean by not\\r\\nworrying? You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Look at my nose, to say\\r\\nnothing of the bump on my shins. My, oh, my, isn't anybody worried\\r\\nabout me?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I am, your majesty,\\\" put in Zep, \\\"and I think the Queen ought to be,\\r\\ntoo.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"She ought not,\\\" snapped the monarch, scrambling to his feet. \\\"If I\\r\\nwanted her to be glad she _would_ be worried, but as I want her to be\\r\\nworried, she is _not_. You must be a stranger here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He is,\\\" said the Poppykok. \\\"He just arrived. I only caught him a\\r\\nlittle while ago.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told the Emperor who Zep was. \\\"This boy,\\\" he said, \\\"is a\\r\\nPrince, and has his own way more than anybody else in his father's\\r\\nkingdom. In fact, he is one of the most delightfully stubborn young\\r\\npersons I have ever met, and _never_ will do what any one wants him to\\r\\nif he can possibly help it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My,\\\" said the Emperor, grasping Zep's hand and shaking it warmly,\\r\\n\\\"if that isn't the finest record I ever heard of. I couldn't be more\\r\\npig-headed myself. How did you get so? Did you learn it at school or\\r\\njust teach yourself?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Zep, feeling rather proud, \\\"I just picked it up, I guess.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the monarch, \\\"there is nothing like it to my mind.\\r\\nPerhaps you've read my famous poem on the subject? Have you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Zep, \\\"I never heard of it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Humph!\\\" said the Emperor, looking rather disappointed. \\\"You're not\\r\\nvery literary, are you? However, there is no reason why you should not\\r\\nhear it now. Listen.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    When I was a lad, I said to myself\\r\\n    As I hooked the jam from the pantry shelf,\\r\\n      \\\"I may grow up and I may grow old\\r\\n      But I hope I'll never do as I'm told.\\r\\n    \\\"For all the fun I've ever had,\\r\\n    \\\"Has always come from being bad.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    So I started out on my wild career,\\r\\n    And I did so well that I'm Emperor here,\\r\\n      Where you're told to do this, and you simply don't--\\r\\n      And you're asked to do that, and you say you won't.\\r\\n    And _my_ what a lot of fun I've had--\\r\\n    For I _never_ mind, and I'm awful bad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You can see,\\\" said the Emperor, when he had finished, \\\"what a splendid\\r\\nplace you have come to. And as the years pass, I hope you may find it\\r\\neven more delightful.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"As the years pass,\\\" repeated Zep. \\\"Why--why, I can't stay here for\\r\\nyears. What would my folks say?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If you ask me,\\\" put in the Poppykok, \\\"I should say they'd say: 'thank\\r\\ngoodness, he's gone at last.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"it's only in Obstinate Town that people like\\r\\nboys like you. Everywhere else they think you're a nuisance. Didn't you\\r\\nknow that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why, no,\\\" said Zep. \\\"I--I thought everybody liked me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ho, ho, ho!\\\" roared the Poppykok, shaking with merriment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hee, hee, hee!\\\" cackled the Emperor, \\\"my word, that's good! You ought\\r\\nto send that to a comic paper. He thought everybody liked him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Zep, sulkily, \\\"they always acted as though they did. I--I\\r\\nlike people to like me. But as long as they don't I'll _never_ go back.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's the stuff,\\\" said the Emperor. \\\"Don't you do it. You stay here\\r\\nwith me and enjoy yourself. Do as you please. Be as cranky as you like.\\r\\nWhy, I wouldn't be surprised if you'd be a popular idol some day if you\\r\\ngo on the way you've begun.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Zep settled down in Obstinate Town determined to enjoy himself with\\r\\nall his might. And because he was a prince, the Emperor let him live in\\r\\nthe palace and eat his meals at the royal table.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, he did not care much for the meals. You never could get what\\r\\nyou wanted. When you asked the royal butler for cold chicken, he would\\r\\nalways tell you he would rather you took cold ham. And if you wanted\\r\\nstewed kidneys, the butler right away said he preferred to give you\\r\\nbroiled oysters. No matter what you asked for, the stubborn old butler\\r\\nalways insisted on giving you something else, whether you liked it or\\r\\nnot. And such an arrangement made Zep awfully cross.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't see why you have such a butler,\\\" he said to the Emperor. \\\"When\\r\\nI ask our butler at home for anything, he gives it to me quick. He\\r\\nwouldn't _dare_ give me anything else. If he did my father would hang\\r\\nhim.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Humph!\\\" responded the Emperor, \\\"it seems to me your father must be a\\r\\nvery cruel person. The idea of hanging any one for wanting his own way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Zep, \\\"it's so--so inconvenient. If they have their own way\\r\\nhow can you have yours?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"you can't, with a butler, unless you go to\\r\\nthe pantry and help yourself. And yet, why shouldn't he have his way as\\r\\nwell as you? Why shouldn't he?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Prince did not know what to say to that. But nevertheless it\\r\\nwas tough to have every one else having their own way as well as you.\\r\\nWhen you got in a trolley car and told the conductor to let you off at\\r\\na certain street, he would stop the car at another street, and unless\\r\\nyou were stronger than he, would put you off there no matter how much\\r\\nyou struggled and yelled. And one day, when the Emperor and Zep were\\r\\nput off six blocks from their destination, the monarch was dreadfully\\r\\nangry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know I told you I thought other people ought to have their own way\\r\\nthe same as you and I,\\\" he said to Zep, \\\"but when a conductor not only\\r\\nputs me off his car before I want to get off, but kicks me into the\\r\\nbargain, it's too much.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's what I think,\\\" said Zep, \\\"and if I were you I'd issue a royal\\r\\ndecree saying that only the upper classes can have their own way\\r\\n_always_, and that the lower classes can only have their own way, when\\r\\nit suits the upper classes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A good idea,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"I'll do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd despite the fact that it made the lower classes fairly purple with\\r\\nindignation, the decree was issued at once, and Zep, and the Emperor,\\r\\nand the rest of the upper classes, did as they liked whenever they\\r\\nwanted to, and had a fine time doing it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I tell you what,\\\" said the Emperor to the Prince one morning after\\r\\nbreakfast as he finished reading the paper, \\\"that was a grand idea of\\r\\nyours, Zep, about letting the lower classes have their own way only\\r\\nwhen it suited us. Life has been much sweeter ever since.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think so, too,\\\" said Zep, \\\"except that if _nobody_ else could have\\r\\ntheir own way, it would be sweeter still.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hum,\\\" said the monarch, \\\"I never thought of that. And the more I think\\r\\nof it, the more I think you're right. I know what I'll do. I'll issue\\r\\nanother decree putting all the upper classes into the lower classes,\\r\\nexcept myself. Then I can do whatever I want, no matter what anybody\\r\\nsays.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Zep, \\\"you wouldn't put me in the lower classes, would you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why not,\\\" replied the Emperor. \\\"Suppose I wanted my own way about\\r\\nsomething at the same time that you wanted your own way about it, the\\r\\nonly way it could be managed without a fight, would be for you to be in\\r\\nthe lower classes where you couldn't have your own way unless it suited\\r\\nme. See?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Zep, sulkily, \\\"I see, but I don't think it's fair. Why not\\r\\nput yourself in the lower classes and let me stay in the upper class?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Impossible,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"for if any one ever belonged to the\\r\\nupper classes an Emperor does.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So does a prince,\\\" said Zep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not necessarily,\\\" replied the monarch. \\\"I had a dog named Prince once,\\r\\nbut you never heard of a dog named Emperor, did you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as Zep could think of nothing to say to that, the Emperor issued\\r\\nhis decree, and Zep and all the rest of the upper classes were put in\\r\\nthe lower classes, and the monarch enjoyed himself more than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the Emperor enjoyed himself, Zep and the rest of the upper\\r\\nclasses did not. For if they wanted to do something the Emperor always\\r\\nwanted them to do something different. And if he did not want that, he\\r\\nwanted them to do something nobody could do. And as Zep lived in the\\r\\npalace he had it worse than anybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was told to hold his breath for an hour; to stand on his ear for\\r\\nhalf an hour, and not wink for fifteen minutes. And when he did not do\\r\\nwhat he was told because he could not, the Emperor stuck pins in him\\r\\nand dared him to yell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"See here,\\\" said Zep to the monarch, \\\"I used to like you but I don't a\\r\\nbit any more. I'm going back home right off.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"go ahead. I'm tired of you anyway. The\\r\\nidea of a strong, healthy boy not being able to stand on his ear, and\\r\\nmaking such a fuss, too, because a few pins are stuck in him. Go on,\\r\\n_go_ back home.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Zep, \\\"how will I get there? I--I don't know the way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course you don't,\\\" replied the monarch, \\\"nobody does. There isn't\\r\\nany way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Isn't any way?\\\" repeated the Prince in a tone of horror. \\\"Why--why,\\r\\nhave I got to stay here with _you_ always?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emperor nodded. \\\"Sure thing, unless a Kokkipop sends you back. The\\r\\nPoppykoks bring you here and the Kokkipops send you back. But as no one\\r\\never wants to _go_ back it's mighty hard to find a Kokkipop, so I guess\\r\\nI'll be sticking pins in you for some time yet. Ho, ho, ho!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you can be sure when the Emperor said that and laughed about it,\\r\\ntoo, Zep felt about as gloomy as he ever had in his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" he said, \\\"what on earth shall I do? If only I can get away\\r\\nfrom this nasty old place I'll never want my own way again. I'll be a\\r\\ndifferent boy. I never--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Here, here,\\\" put in the Emperor, sternly, \\\"stop that talk. You mustn't\\r\\nsay such things as that. No one ever talks about not wanting their own\\r\\nway in Obstinate Town. It's downright treason. Do you want to go to\\r\\nprison? But anyhow, I don't suppose you meant it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed, I did,\\\" said Zep, \\\"I meant every word I said. I'm tired of\\r\\nhaving my own way--it's silly. Look at the mess it's got me into. I'm\\r\\ngoing to be different--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Stop!\\\" shrieked the Emperor, at the top of his lungs, \\\"stop, I say!\\r\\nYou'll have a Kokkipop here in another moment, and oh, how I hate 'em.\\r\\nI hate 'em worse than--than spiders. And--and, my goodness gracious\\r\\nsakes alive, you've brought one--you've brought one. Run, run, or the\\r\\nKokkipop will get you!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that the Emperor dived under his throne, while the Prince,\\r\\nlooking about with a startled air, did not know whether to flee or\\r\\nnot. And then, as he hesitated, a very brisk old gentleman, dressed in\\r\\nbright yellow, came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Did you call?\\\" he asked Zep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Call,\\\" said the boy, \\\"why--why, no. What do you mean?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Did you call for a Kokkipop?\\\" repeated the other testily. \\\"And for\\r\\nmercy's sake don't say you didn't, for I've been waiting for a call all\\r\\nmy life. I was a young man when I joined the Kokkipops, and in all that\\r\\ntime I have never been called until now. So I hope you did call. Did\\r\\nyou?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Zep, \\\"I said I wanted to go home, if that's what you mean.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And you said you didn't want your own way any more, didn't you?\\\"\\r\\ninquired the Kokkipop, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" replied the Prince, \\\"I did. And I don't.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He does, too,\\\" put in the Emperor, sticking his head out from under\\r\\nhis throne. \\\"He doesn't mean what he says. He's just mad at me for\\r\\nsticking pins in him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't believe it,\\\" said the Kokkipop, scowling at the Emperor,\\r\\n\\\"you're just trying to keep me out of a job.\\\" Then he turned to the\\r\\nPrince. \\\"You did mean what you said, didn't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I certainly did,\\\" said Zep, \\\"and--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Whoopee!\\\" yelled the Kokkipop, joyfully, \\\"then I _have_ got a job at\\r\\nlast.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon he took off his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and began to\\r\\npaste magic postage stamps all over the Prince. \\\"There,\\\" he said,\\r\\nstanding off to admire his work, \\\"I guess that will take you back all\\r\\nright.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Take him back,\\\" sneered the Emperor, crawling from under his throne,\\r\\n\\\"why it'll take him twice over. You've put excess postage on him. Shows\\r\\nwhat a Kokkipop knows about his business.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Is that so,\\\" retorted the Kokkipop, \\\"well, I know enough to send this\\r\\nboy where you won't stick pins in him any more, and where he won't want\\r\\nhis own way any more.\\\" He turned to Zep. \\\"Isn't that so?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes, indeed,\\\" said the Prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" responded the Kokkipop, \\\"here's to a quick and comfortable\\r\\ntrip. Good-by, I'll see you later.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No--wait!\\\" shouted the Emperor, running toward Zep, \\\"don't go. I'll\\r\\nput you in the upper classes again. I'll--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was no use. Once again Zep felt himself leap into the air, and\\r\\nwhiz, and whiz, and whiz, even faster than he had before. And then just\\r\\nas he was beginning to get used to the whizzing and rather enjoy it, he\\r\\ncommenced to descend in a graceful curve, and presently landed with a\\r\\nbump in the gardens adjoining his father's palace. And there, sitting\\r\\non the grass, was the Kokkipop waiting for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Greeting,\\\" said the Kokkipop, \\\"did you have a nice trip?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Fine,\\\" said Zep, \\\"but of course I'm glad it's over and that I'm safe\\r\\nhome again. And of course I'm awfully obliged to you for getting me out\\r\\nof such a scrape.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, that's all right,\\\" said the Kokkipop, as he peeled off the magic\\r\\npostage stamps, \\\"it's been a pleasure to help you. And who knows but\\r\\nyou may try to have your own way again and be taken back to Obstinate\\r\\nTown. And if you do, don't forget I'm always glad to get a job.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Zep, \\\"I won't, but I never expect to visit Obstinate\\r\\nTown again if I can help it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure enough Zep never did. From that moment he was a changed boy,\\r\\nso much so that it really worried his father, the king.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't understand it,\\\" said the King to his Prime Minister. \\\"He does\\r\\njust what I tell him and never whines; and when he takes a walk he\\r\\njumps about a foot if a leaf falls on him. I don't understand it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the King did not, Zep did, and was determined no Poppykok should\\r\\nget another chance at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           TOOBAD THE TAILOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there lived in the city of Vex a tailor named Toobad, which was\\r\\na very good name for him, for he really was too bad for anything,\\r\\nin fact, he was downright wicked. And not only was he wicked but he\\r\\nwas also deceitful, because he was really not a tailor at all but an\\r\\nenchanter or conjuror, and only practiced a tailor's trade to fool the\\r\\nfathers, and grandfathers, and uncles, and big brothers of the little\\r\\nboys of Vex, and make them pay him money. And this is the way he did it:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put a sign in his window and offered to make clothes for gentlemen\\r\\nvery, very cheap out of the very, very best materials that would never\\r\\nwear out, and of course when he offered to do _that_ all the fathers,\\r\\nand grandfathers, and uncles, and big brothers went and ordered their\\r\\nsuits from him as quick as they could. But after the clothes were made\\r\\nand the fathers, and grandfathers, and uncles, and big brothers had\\r\\nput them on, _then_ they found out, when it was too late, what sort of\\r\\na person Toobad was, for they had to keep on paying, and paying, and\\r\\npaying for the clothes forever and forever. If they did not the suits\\r\\nthey were wearing got tighter and tighter until their breath was almost\\r\\nsqueezed out of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no use to try to get the clothes off because they simply would\\r\\n_not_ come off. So you can imagine how cross and miserable all the\\r\\nfathers, and grandfathers, and uncles, and big brothers in Vex were.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there were lots of little boys in Vex, but the most interesting one\\r\\nwas a bright little fellow named Winn, because in _his_ family there\\r\\nhappened to be a father, _and_ a grandfather, _and_ an uncle, _and_ a\\r\\nbig brother all wearing suits made by Toobad the Tailor, whereas the\\r\\nother boys only had a father, _or_ a grandfather, _or_ an uncle, _or_ a\\r\\nbig brother. None of them had all four together, and therefore did not\\r\\nhave as much cause to dislike Toobad as Winn had.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course when Winn's father, and grandfather, and his uncle and his\\r\\nbig brother, had paid for their suits _once_ and Toobad had told\\r\\nthem they must keep right on paying every week, they said they would\\r\\n_not_. But after the suits had squeezed them once or twice, and after\\r\\nthey had tried to get the clothes off and found they could not, they\\r\\nchanged their minds. And every Saturday night as soon as they got their\\r\\nsalaries they rushed right down to Toobad's shop and paid him, so they\\r\\nwould have a comfortable Sunday, which did not please Winn's mother at\\r\\nall because it left very little to buy food with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Good gracious,\\\" she used to say to Winn's father, and grandfather, and\\r\\nuncle, and big brother, \\\"if you keep on giving that tailor half your\\r\\nmoney, I don't know how I'll get along.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" said Winn's father, who was very fat, \\\"and if I don't pay it\\r\\nI don't know how _I'll_ get along. I've got to breathe, haven't I?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Winn's grandfather, and his uncle, and his big brother, who\\r\\nwere all as fat as his father, \\\"we would much rather breathe than eat.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right, then,\\\" said Winn's mother, \\\"go ahead and breathe but don't\\r\\nblame me if you starve also, for food is so high, I can buy very little\\r\\nwith the money you give me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when she said that Winn's father, and his grandfather, and his\\r\\nuncle, and his big brother would groan awfully, which made Winn and his\\r\\nmother as blue as indigo, for they knew if Toobad was not paid, the\\r\\nclothes Winn's father, and grandfather, and uncle and big brother wore\\r\\nwould squeeze them tighter and tighter so they could not work at all,\\r\\nand yet if he was paid there would not be enough money left to keep the\\r\\nwolf from the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo finally Winn determined to go and see Toobad and try and coax him\\r\\nnot to be so hard on his folks. \\\"Maybe if I offer to be his errand\\r\\nboy,\\\" he said, \\\"he'll agree to let us stop paying for a while until we\\r\\ncatch up with our grocery bills.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he got to the tailor's shop he had a very hard time to coax\\r\\nToobad into having an errand boy. \\\"No, no,\\\" said the enchanter,\\r\\ntestily, \\\"I don't need an errand boy, and even if I did need one I need\\r\\nthe money your family pays me much more.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But think how stylish it is for a tailor to have an errand boy,\\\" said\\r\\nWinn. \\\"All fashionable tailors send clothes home to their customers.\\r\\nThey never ask customers to come after their clothes. I should think\\r\\nyou'd be _ashamed_ not to have an errand boy.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, finally, after talking and talking, Toobad agreed to hire Winn as\\r\\nhis errand boy, and instead of giving him wages to let his family stop\\r\\npaying for their clothes for a few weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But remember this,\\\" said the tailor, \\\"you are not to tell any one\\r\\nabout the arrangement, because if you do all my customers will want to\\r\\nstop paying until they get caught up on their grocery bills.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Winn promised to keep the matter secret and the next morning started\\r\\nin on his duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it happened that one of the first persons he delivered clothes\\r\\nto was a second cousin of his mother's aunt. This second cousin had\\r\\nnot heard of the trouble in Winn's family because Winn's father, and\\r\\ngrandfather, and uncle, and big brother had been afraid to tell any\\r\\none what Toobad had done to them for fear their clothes would squeeze\\r\\nthem worse than ever. So when Winn delivered his mother's aunt's second\\r\\ncousin's clothes he did not know whether to warn him about putting them\\r\\non or not. And while he was trying to make up his mind about it, his\\r\\nmother's aunt's second cousin went into another room to get the money\\r\\nto pay for the clothes, and when he came out he had the clothes on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gee whiz,\\\" he said proudly, \\\"don't they fit me grand?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Maybe they do,\\\" said Winn, \\\"but I was just going to tell you not to\\r\\nput them on, because now you can't get them off, and you've got to keep\\r\\non paying for them forever and forever.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What!\\\" yelled his mother's aunt's second cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then with another yell he began tearing at the clothes with all\\r\\nhis might, trying to get them off, but of course it was no use for\\r\\nalthough he almost turned himself inside out, they stuck to him like\\r\\nsticking plaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: He began tearing at his clothes with all his might]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You're a nice one!\\\" he shouted, shaking his finger under Winn's nose.\\r\\n\\\"You ought to be arrested. How dared you sit there and let me put these\\r\\nawful things on? I just hope your father, and your grandfather, and\\r\\nyour uncle, and your big brother get stuck the same way. I certainly\\r\\ndo!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"They _are_ stuck,\\\" said Winn. \\\"They've been stuck for some time. That\\r\\nis why I am working for Toobad. And I'm very sorry I did not warn you\\r\\nabout the clothes in time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he told his mother's aunt's second cousin what a fix his folks\\r\\nwere in and how if you did not pay for the clothes every week they\\r\\nsqueezed you until you did.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sakes alive!\\\" groaned his mother's aunt's second cousin, \\\"isn't it\\r\\ndreadful the trouble some people have? Here I am all dressed up fine\\r\\nbut I can't enjoy it a bit after what you've told me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he escorted Winn to the door and said he never wanted to see his\\r\\nface again. \\\"I'm sorry to have to say it,\\\" he continued, \\\"but until\\r\\nyou came a little while ago my life was full of sunshine and now it is\\r\\nnothing but a mud puddle. But I forgive you. Good-by!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you may be sure Winn felt terribly gloomy as he went back to\\r\\nToobad's shop. When he hired out as the tailor's errand boy in order to\\r\\nhelp his family, he had not thought how he would be bringing distress\\r\\ninto other families by delivering Toobad's enchanted clothes. But he\\r\\ncould see now, after the scene with his mother's aunt's second cousin,\\r\\nhow selfish and wicked it was for him to help Toobad get other people\\r\\ninto trouble in order to make things easier for his own folks. So he\\r\\ndetermined that he would give up his job right away.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I've decided not to be your errand boy any longer,\\\" he said to the\\r\\nenchanter, as he handed him the money he had received from his mother's\\r\\naunt's second cousin. \\\"I find you are too wicked to work for.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Humph!\\\" said the tailor, \\\"and why am I any wickeder now than I was\\r\\nthis morning? You were glad to work for me then.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know,\\\" said Winn, \\\"but I have just seen my mother's aunt's second\\r\\ncousin turn from a carefree, happy person into a miserable wretch, and\\r\\nall because I delivered him one of your enchanted suits of clothes.\\r\\nAnd I cannot help you in your crimes any longer even if my family do\\r\\nsuffer. Good afternoon!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Good afternoon nothing!\\\" shouted Toobad. \\\"Come back here at once.\\r\\nYesterday when I did not want an errand boy you talked me into having\\r\\none, and now that I've gotten used to having one you want me to do\\r\\nwithout one. Well, I shan't do it. You'll work for me whether you want\\r\\nto or not.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he stretched out his hand toward Winn and then drew it\\r\\nback and when he drew it back something mysterious drew Winn back\\r\\nalso, and though he tried to get to the door he could not move.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Toobad, \\\"will you work for me or not?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Winn, firmly, \\\"I will never work for you if I can help it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well, then,\\\" said the enchanter, \\\"you shall work for me because\\r\\nyou cannot help it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he repeated the alphabet backward like lightning,\\r\\nwiggling his fingers at the same time, and in a flash Winn was\\r\\ntransformed into a tailor's dummy, after which Toobad placed him on the\\r\\nsidewalk outside his shop with one of the enchanted suits on him and\\r\\nwith a sign on his breast which read:\\r\\n\\r\\n                        TAKE ME HOME FOR $3.75\\r\\n\\r\\nso people could see what fine, cheap clothes were sold inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd maybe Winn did not feel bad as he stood there day after day not\\r\\neven able to roll his eyes or move or speak. And on Saturday night he\\r\\nfelt particularly bad because his father, and his grandfather, and his\\r\\nuncle, and his big brother came by the shop arm in arm, all whistling\\r\\nmerrily because they did not have to pay Toobad any money that week and\\r\\nwere going to a movie instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My, my!\\\" they exclaimed, when they saw Winn by the door, \\\"doesn't that\\r\\nimage look exactly like our Winn, but of course it cannot be because\\r\\nit's made of wax.\\\" And then the next moment they went on their way as\\r\\nhappy as larks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear!\\\" said Winn to himself, miserably, \\\"whatever am I going to\\r\\ndo? How am I ever going to escape from this terrible tailor? If only I\\r\\ncould think of _some_ way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd later when Toobad had brought him indoors and shut the shop, and\\r\\ngone off to bed and left him standing in a dark corner, he thought and\\r\\nthought with all his might, for he felt if he did not find _some_ way\\r\\nto break the enchantment he might as well die.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then as he was still puzzling over the problem he heard a stealthy\\r\\nstep, and into the room came Toobad in his nightgown, holding a\\r\\nlighted candle in his hand, and Winn saw that he was walking in his\\r\\nsleep. And not only was he walking in his sleep but he was talking in\\r\\nhis sleep also, and this is what he was saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Of all the gents who wear my clothes\\r\\n      Not one has ever guessed, sir,\\r\\n    That he could break the magic spell\\r\\n      By pulling down his vest, sir.\\r\\n    Oh, yes, indeed, there is no need\\r\\n      Why he should be distressed, sir,\\r\\n    If he but knows enchanted clothes\\r\\n      Are governed by the vest, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Winn heard what he was saying he knew right away that if he\\r\\ncould only escape he could easily get his father, and grandfather, and\\r\\nuncle, and big brother out of the power of Toobad the tailor, for he\\r\\nonly had to tell them to pull down their vests and they would be rid\\r\\nforever of the hateful clothing they were wearing. But alas, it was one\\r\\nthing to want to get home, and another to get there, for while he was\\r\\ntransformed into a tailor's dummy he was utterly helpless and could\\r\\nonly stand and watch Toobad as he wandered about the shop with his eyes\\r\\nshut and the lighted candle in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then all of a sudden something happened that transformed him from\\r\\na tailor's dummy into a very real boy, for Toobad, not seeing where\\r\\nhe was going, bumped right into him and the flame of the candle came\\r\\nright against Winn's nose--only for a moment--but it was long enough to\\r\\nscorch it and to make Winn yell--ouch! at the top of his lungs, and to\\r\\njoggle all the enchantment out of him. And if you did not believe an\\r\\nenchanted person can be cured by scorching his nose, just get yourself\\r\\nenchanted and scorch your nose and see if it does not work.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, it cured Winn, and not only that but it woke Toobad up. And\\r\\nwhen the tailor found himself in his shop with his nightgown on, and\\r\\nfound Winn changed from a dummy into a regular boy again, he was\\r\\nfurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Zounds!\\\" he shrieked, dancing up and down, \\\"how the--what the--where\\r\\ndid I come from and how did you get all right again?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Winn told him he was more furious than ever. \\\"Well,\\\" he said,\\r\\n\\\"I'll soon fix you anyway.\\\" And thereupon he began to say the alphabet\\r\\nbackward the same as he had done before, but by the time he had said\\r\\nthree letters and before the enchantment had had time to work, Winn\\r\\nrushed at him and knocked the candle to the floor. And then while the\\r\\nshop was in darkness he unhooked the door and ran home as fast as he\\r\\ncould. When he got there it was past midnight and of course every one\\r\\nwas asleep, but by and by his mother heard him knocking and let him in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you may be sure it did not take his father, or his grandfather, or\\r\\nhis uncle, or his big brother long to hop out of bed where they had\\r\\nbeen sleeping with their clothes on because they could not get them\\r\\noff. And maybe they were not surprised when they learned that Winn had\\r\\nreally been the tailor's dummy they had seen outside the shop. And\\r\\nmaybe they were not delighted when they found that Winn knew of a way\\r\\nfor them to get rid of the enchanted clothes. And maybe they did not\\r\\npull down their vests in a hurry as soon as Winn had finished telling\\r\\nthem about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My gracious,\\\" said Winn's grandfather, as he peeled the last of the\\r\\nhated garments from him, \\\"I feel twenty years younger. And I can hardly\\r\\nwait until morning to get my hands on that villainous tailor.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nor I,\\\" said Winn's father.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Me, too,\\\" said Winn's uncle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I daren't tell you what _I'll_ do to him,\\\" said Winn's big brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the first thing after breakfast they all went around to Toobad's\\r\\nshop dressed in their old clothes, and each one of them kept his word\\r\\nso well that Toobad was laid up in the hospital for a week. And every\\r\\ntime he got well and came out again a fresh batch of victims was\\r\\nwaiting to send him back again, for Winn had gone all about the city\\r\\ntelling everybody who had bought the enchanted clothes, how to pull\\r\\ndown their vests and get rid of them. And, of course, one of the first\\r\\npersons he told after his immediate family was his mother's aunt's\\r\\nsecond cousin. But as his mother's aunt's second cousin had forgotten\\r\\nto put on his vest when he donned his enchanted suit, he could not pull\\r\\nhis vest down. And so the only thing to do was to give him chloroform\\r\\nand skin the clothes off him a little strip at a time. After which they\\r\\nsent _him_ to the hospital also, where he lay in bed right alongside of\\r\\nToobad the tailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd perhaps that is the reason Toobad is still in the hospital, for\\r\\nafter Winn's mother's aunt's second cousin got well, he refused to\\r\\ngo home, but sat down on the hospital steps to wait for Toobad. And\\r\\nneither Winn's father, nor his grandfather, nor his uncle, nor his big\\r\\nbrother, were able to coax him away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as for Winn, he did not try to coax him, indeed he soon forgot\\r\\nall about his mother's aunt's second cousin, for all the persons in\\r\\nVex who had been wearing Toobad's enchanted clothes, began sending\\r\\nWinn presents to show their gratitude, and when you have sixteen gold\\r\\nwatches, and a couple of ponies, and skates, and air guns, and pretty\\r\\nmuch every sort of a thing that a boy likes, you cannot think of much\\r\\nelse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best you can do is just to enjoy yourself, and if you think Winn is\\r\\nnot doing that, take a trip to Vex some day and you will soon find out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           THE SNOOPING-BUG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a Snooping Bug that lived in a glass jar on a shelf\\r\\nin the cottage of a Fairy Godmother. Now fairy godmothers are always\\r\\nnice, but this Fairy Godmother was _very_ nice, and the reason she kept\\r\\nthe Snooping Bug a prisoner in a jar on her shelf was because she was\\r\\nafraid he would go about and get folks into trouble. And another thing\\r\\nthat showed she was unusually nice was that every week-end she always\\r\\ninvited a little prince or princess to be her guest. And this story\\r\\nopens just as Prince Pranc, the only son of the king of a nearby city,\\r\\nhad arrived to spend several days with his Fairy Godmother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now, Pranc,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother, \\\"I want you to have the\\r\\nhappiest kind of a time, and you'll have it without doubt if you don't\\r\\nget into mischief.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, that's all right,\\\" replied the Prince, as he watched the Fairy\\r\\nGodmother unpack his trunk, \\\"if I get into mischief you just send me\\r\\nhome again.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother, \\\"but suppose you are not here to\\r\\nsend home again; suppose you have disappeared. Don't forget this is\\r\\nan enchanted house and that strange things can happen in an enchanted\\r\\nhouse.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Phew!\\\" said Pranc, \\\"I almost wish I hadn't come.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" replied the Fairy Godmother, \\\"there is nothing to be\\r\\nalarmed about. You could sit on a keg of gunpowder and be perfectly\\r\\nsafe if you didn't explode the powder. But in case you should get into\\r\\ntrouble, put this ring on your finger and turn it around and around\\r\\nwhen danger threatens.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, thank you,\\\" said the Prince, slipping on the ring. \\\"I don't feel\\r\\nso worried now.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Fairy Godmother took him all over the cottage and showed him\\r\\nthe wonderful belongings she had, and last of all she took him into\\r\\nher study and there Pranc saw the Snooping Bug in his jar on the shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What's that?\\\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the Fairy Godmother told him it was a Snooping Bug. \\\"And this one,\\\"\\r\\nshe continued, pointing to another jar on the shelf, \\\"has a Sulking Bug\\r\\nin it; and this one--next to it, is a Crying Bug. If they got out of\\r\\nthe jars they'd bite you, and you'd start in to snoop, or sulk, or cry.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Whoever heard of such a thing,\\\" said the Prince. \\\"It can't be.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It can't, eh,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother. \\\"Just put your finger on the\\r\\ntop of this bottle when I take the cork out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that she took the magic stopper out of the Crying Bug\\r\\nbottle and Pranc stuck his finger in. And then--ping--the next\\r\\nmoment something bit it, and the _next_ moment he burst out crying,\\r\\nboo-hoo--boo-hoo, as loud as he could. And as he was a boy who hardly\\r\\n_ever_ cried, he felt awfully ashamed of himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" he sobbed, \\\"I hate to cry this way, but--but--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Don't worry,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother, as she corked the bottle\\r\\nagain, \\\"he only gave you a little bite. You'll be over it in a minute.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd presently the tears stopped rolling down Pranc's cheeks and he was\\r\\nall right once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My goodness,\\\" he said, as he wiped his eyes, \\\"I wouldn't like that to\\r\\nhappen again.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother, \\\"see that you keep hands off these\\r\\nbottles. As long as the bugs stay in the bottles everything will be all\\r\\nright, but if they once get out they'll bite every girl and boy they\\r\\nfind. That is why I keep them prisoners. I don't care for snooping,\\r\\nsulking or crying children, nor does any one else.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she told Pranc that she would have to leave him for awhile. \\\"I\\r\\nhave been invited to the christening of a princess,\\\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she put on her gossamer cloak and her diamond studded bonnet, kissed\\r\\nher hand to Pranc and went off to the christening. But so interested\\r\\nwas Pranc in the bugs on the shelf he hardly noticed her going, for\\r\\nthe Sulking Bug looked so mad it almost startled him, and the Crying\\r\\nBug had cried so much his bottle was half full of tears and he looked\\r\\nalmost as mad as the Sulking Bug. But when it came to the Snooping\\r\\nBug, it was a very different affair altogether, for the Snooping Bug,\\r\\nalthough he had a sly sort of expression in his big, pop eyes, was real\\r\\njolly looking as he slowly scratched his shoulder blade with his hind\\r\\nleg. And when he saw the Prince looking at him, he winked one eye and\\r\\nthen turned a couple of somersaults, which made the Prince laugh like\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gee whiz,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"I like this bug.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in order to get a better look at the creature he reached the jar\\r\\ndown from the shelf and carried it over to the window, or at least\\r\\nhe started to, but before he got there he stumbled--bing--the jar\\r\\nslipped from his hands, fell to the floor with a crash and broke into a\\r\\nthousand pieces, leaving the Snooping Bug kicking in the midst of the\\r\\nfragments.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: The jar broke into a thousand pieces]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried the Prince, \\\"I must get something to put him in or he'll\\r\\nget away.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Nonsense,\\\" remarked the Snooping Bug. \\\"I'm not going away. You\\r\\ncouldn't drive me away. I'm going to stay with you. But do get me out\\r\\nof this mess, please.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Pranc, not suspecting anything, stooped to pick the Snooping Bug up\\r\\nand then as he did so--zip, the Bug bit his finger and in about eight\\r\\nseconds he changed from a first class little boy who always minded his\\r\\nown business and did not pry into things, into a sly, snooping fellow\\r\\npeering into corners, and closets, and everything. And as he changed,\\r\\nthe Snooping Bug changed also. It swelled, and swelled, and swelled\\r\\nuntil it was half as big as Pranc. After which it chuckled, wiggling\\r\\nthe two long, wavy horns that grew over its eyebrows, and took the\\r\\nPrince by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Come on,\\\" it said, \\\"let's start. My, but it feels good to get out of\\r\\nthat jar.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Start,\\\" said Pranc, \\\"start where?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why, to headquarters,\\\" replied the Snooping Bug, \\\"where you can snoop\\r\\nall you want.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo off they went to the Fairy Godmother's preserve closet. \\\"Open the\\r\\ndoor,\\\" said the Snooping Bug. And when the Prince had done so the\\r\\nSnooping Bug pushed Pranc inside and then followed, shutting the door\\r\\nafter him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My, but it's dark,\\\" exclaimed the Prince. \\\"What are we going to do\\r\\nnow?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Just you wait,\\\" said the Snooping Bug. Then he called out: \\\"Going\\r\\ndown!\\\" And all of a sudden a brilliantly lighted elevator came down\\r\\nright in front of them, the door slid open, Pranc and the Snooping Bug\\r\\nstepped inside, and then, ker-zip, ker-zip, ker-zip, the elevator began\\r\\nto drop, and drop, and drop, with the most awful dips.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoodness, how they did drop. The Prince thought they must have dropped\\r\\nabout nine hundred miles when at last the elevator stopped after giving\\r\\na terrible bounce or two, and the Snooping Bug shouted: \\\"Here we are!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPranc wondered where \\\"here we are\\\" was as he looked up and down the\\r\\nstreet in which he presently found himself standing, and was about to\\r\\nask the Snooping Bug, when all of a sudden somebody bumped into him and\\r\\nhe turned to see a tall, slim fellow in a pink uniform with his hands\\r\\nfull of letters which he had been reading as he walked along. Over one\\r\\nshoulder hung a leather bag which was crammed with other letters still\\r\\nin their envelopes, and on his head was a cap with a tassel and on the\\r\\nfront of the cap it said \\\"postman.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What do you mean,\\\" cried the stranger, sternly, \\\"by interfering with\\r\\nthe mails? Can't you see I'm on government duty?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, excuse me,\\\" said Pranc, \\\"I didn't mean to bump you, and I wouldn't\\r\\nhave done it if you hadn't been reading those letters as you walked\\r\\nalong.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" said the postman, \\\"well if I didn't read some of the letters\\r\\nas I walked about delivering them I don't know what I _would_ do. I\\r\\ncan't read _all_ of 'em at night, you know.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"they are not your letters, are they?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course not,\\\" said the postman, testily, \\\"who would write me\\r\\nall this lot of letters? They belong to the different citizens of\\r\\nSnoopania.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"you don't read other people's letters, I hope.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" retorted the postman, opening his eyes very wide, \\\"I should\\r\\nhope I did. If I didn't I'd lose my job. Every letter must be torn open\\r\\nand read, and every postal card must not only be read but committed to\\r\\nmemory. I could shut my eyes right now and tell you what I've read on\\r\\na million postal cards only I haven't the time. This is the way of it,\\r\\nyou see:\\r\\n\\r\\n    A postman's life is a busy one,\\r\\n    His working hours are never done,\\r\\n    For all of the letters the public writes\\r\\n    He has to read at home at nights;\\r\\n    And all of the postals, yes, sir-ee,\\r\\n    He has to commit to memoree.\\r\\n    And so if you think I'm cross a bit\\r\\n    You'll know my job is the cause of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he finished he suddenly noticed the Snooping Bug. \\\"For mercy's\\r\\nsake,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"when did you get back? I thought the Fairy\\r\\nGodmother had you bottled up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"She did,\\\" said the Snooping Bug, \\\"but thanks to this noble boy I'm out\\r\\nagain. Where can I find the First Lord of the Keyhole? I want to make\\r\\narrangements for parliament to reward my rescuer.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the postman, \\\"I think he's at his office right now, if you\\r\\nhurry.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, after bidding the postman good-by, the Snooping Bug hurried Pranc\\r\\noff to the office of the First Lord of the Keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon they reached Parliament House where the First Lord of the Keyhole\\r\\nhad his office, but when they tried to open the office door it seemed\\r\\nto stick. So Pranc gave it a push, and then a harder one, and all at\\r\\nonce it opened wide and the Prince and the Snooping Bug staggering into\\r\\nthe room saw in the middle of the floor a white-haired old gentleman\\r\\nlying on his back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Shut the door,\\\" commanded the old gentleman, scrambling to his feet.\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" he said, glaring at Pranc as he smoothed his clothing, \\\"I\\r\\nsuppose you know what you've done.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"what have I done?\\\" He looked at the old\\r\\ngentleman and then at the Snooping Bug. The old gentleman was very red\\r\\nin the face and the Snooping Bug seemed to be dreadfully worried. He\\r\\ntook Pranc into a corner and whispered in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Don't be frightened,\\\" he said, rather hoarsely, \\\"but you upset a peer\\r\\nof the realm when you opened the door. He was peering through the\\r\\nkeyhole at you before he said 'Come in,' and you should have peered\\r\\nthrough the keyhole at him before you did come in. I don't know whether\\r\\nI can get you off or not. I ought to have warned you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You certainly ought,\\\" said the Prince. \\\"How was I to know he was at\\r\\nthe keyhole? It seems a very queer thing for an old gentleman like that\\r\\nto do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not at all,\\\" put in the old gentleman. \\\"Ain't I the First Lord of\\r\\nthe Keyhole and head of the House of Peers? And don't all the Peers of\\r\\nSnoopania peer through keyholes? Eh?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Pranc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, they do,\\\" continued the old gentleman, \\\"the same as the members\\r\\nof the House of Commons _listen_ at keyholes. Where have you been all\\r\\nyour life, anyway?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the Prince told him where his home was and how the Snooping\\r\\nBug had brought him to Snoopania. \\\"But,\\\" he added, \\\"I think I'd like to\\r\\ngo back, if you don't mind.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, come now,\\\" put in the Snooping Bug, \\\"you've only just arrived.\\\" He\\r\\nturned to the First Lord of the Keyhole. \\\"I think he's worried for fear\\r\\nyou're going to have him punished for knocking you over. Are you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Certainly,\\\" snapped the First Lord of the Keyhole. \\\"The dignity of the\\r\\npeerage must be maintained.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, I don't think it's fair,\\\" said the Snooping Bug, hotly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course it isn't fair,\\\" retorted the old gentleman. \\\"We never do\\r\\nanything fair in Snoopania. You know that. If we did we wouldn't snoop,\\r\\nwould we?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he clapped his hands and six very jolly looking gentlemen entered\\r\\nin a single file. \\\"This is the Committee on Extermination,\\\" said the\\r\\nFirst Lord of the Keyhole, turning to the Prince. \\\"The Chairman will\\r\\narrange the details of your execution.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"With pleasure,\\\" said the Chairman of the Exterminating Committee, who\\r\\nwas the jolliest looking man of them all. Then he patted Pranc on the\\r\\nhead and asked in a kindly tone _when_ he would like to have his head\\r\\ncut off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What!\\\" exclaimed the Prince, with a startled expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"_When_,\\\" repeated the Chairman, \\\"would you like your head cut off?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"_Never_,\\\" shouted Pranc, as loud as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never,\\\" repeated the Chairman of the Exterminating Committee, looking\\r\\nrather pained. \\\"Oh, but I say that won't do at all. You _must_ fix a\\r\\ntime. We can't cut your head off unless you do. It wouldn't be legal.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" said Pranc, with a sigh of relief. \\\"Well, I'm very glad to\\r\\nhear it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though every member of the Committee on Extermination argued with\\r\\nhim, and the First Lord of the Keyhole shook his fist at him and\\r\\nsputtered like a fire-cracker, he simply would _not_ say when he would\\r\\nlike his head cut off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the First Lord of the Keyhole to the Chairman of the\\r\\nExterminating Committee, \\\"we'll have to appeal to the King about the\\r\\nmatter. This boy doesn't know what he wants.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, yes, he does,\\\" said the Snooping Bug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He does _not_,\\\" thundered the First Lord of the Keyhole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He does, too,\\\" retorted the Snooping Bug, \\\"and if you see the King,\\r\\nwe'll see him, too.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo everybody started off for the palace and never stopped until they\\r\\nstood outside the monarch's sitting-room. \\\"Wait a moment,\\\" said the\\r\\nChairman of the Exterminating Committee, \\\"until I see whether he\\r\\nis busy.\\\" Whereupon he put his eye to the keyhole. \\\"Yes,\\\" he said,\\r\\nstraightening up again, \\\"he is quite busy snooping under his bathroom\\r\\ndoor.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Pranc, \\\"what's the use of that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What's the use of anything?\\\" snapped the First Lord of the Keyhole.\\r\\n\\\"Practice makes perfect, and the more you snoop the better you can do\\r\\nit. The King of Snoopania does not believe in wasting his time, sir.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure enough the monarch did not, for when they opened the door and\\r\\nwent in, he had his head in the fireplace.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, how do you do,\\\" he said, pulling it out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Are you very much engaged?\\\" inquired the Chairman of the Exterminating\\r\\nCommittee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the King, \\\"I only just got through with the bathroom and\\r\\nI did want to finish the chimney this morning, sure, but it doesn't\\r\\nmatter. What is it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This boy,\\\" said the Chairman of the Exterminating Committee, \\\"is to\\r\\nhave his head cut off but he won't say when. He doesn't know what he\\r\\nwants, so we'd like to know if you know.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course he doesn't know,\\\" put in Pranc, impatiently. \\\"I'm the only\\r\\none who knows. And besides what is the use of asking a king who spends\\r\\nhis time peeking up chimneys? I never heard of a king doing such a\\r\\nthing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, if the Prince had walked up to the monarch and boxed his ears\\r\\nhe could not have astonished him or the rest of the party more. For a\\r\\nmoment no one said anything, they just looked at each other in horror,\\r\\nand then the King turned red, white and blue in the face with rage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You--you--you--\\\" he bawled, glaring at Pranc, \\\"you're an imitation\\r\\nsnooper. You don't know the first principles of snooping. What are you\\r\\ndoing in Snoopania anyway?\\\" Then he yelled for his soldiers to come and\\r\\ncut the Prince's head off at once--at once. He repeated it twice so\\r\\nthey would not misunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the Prince did not wait to see whether they understood or not,\\r\\nno sir-ee. He was thoroughly disgusted with snooping, snoopers and\\r\\nSnoopania, and determined to get back to his Fairy Godmother's cottage\\r\\nat once if it could possibly be done. So when the King's soldiers\\r\\nentered the room to seize him he waited until they came very near,\\r\\nand then he twisted the ring the Fairy Godmother had given him, and\\r\\nbing--flat on their backs the soldiers fell, bumping their heads like\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Good-by,\\\" cried Pranc, waving his hand to the Snooping Bug, \\\"I'm going\\r\\nhome.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" shouted the Snooping Bug, \\\"I'll go with you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" replied the Prince, \\\"I've had quite enough of snoopers and\\r\\nsnooping bugs. You stay where you are.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he jumped over the prostrate soldiers and out the door of the\\r\\npalace. Up the street he ran until he met the postman. \\\"Where's the\\r\\nelevator?\\\" he panted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Straight ahead,\\\" replied the postman, \\\"but if you'll wait a moment\\r\\nI'll tell you what was on some of those postal cards I spoke about.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I can't,\\\" said Pranc, \\\"the King's soldiers are after me. I'd like to,\\r\\nbut--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yah!\\\" With a shout a whole regiment of the King's soldiers rushed\\r\\naround the corner and made a grab at him, but quick as a wink Pranc\\r\\ntwisted the Fairy Godmother's ring once more, and bing--over went the\\r\\nsoldiers on their backs and hit their heads bang, and by the time they\\r\\nwere able to sit up and rub the bumps, the Prince had reached the\\r\\nelevator. \\\"Up,\\\" he shouted, and up the elevator went with a leap, and a\\r\\nmoment later stopped inside the preserve closet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My!\\\" said Pranc, as he opened the closet door and stood once more in\\r\\nthe Fairy Godmother's cottage, \\\"my, but I'm glad to be back.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went out on the front porch where the Fairy Godmother was\\r\\nsitting in a rocking chair knitting, and told her all that had happened\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm not surprised,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother. \\\"When I got back from\\r\\nthe christening and found that the Snooping Bug had disappeared and you\\r\\nalso, I knew you had done something you should not have, and that you\\r\\nwere probably having a time of it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"and if it had not been for your ring I would\\r\\nhave had a worse time. I'm awfully sorry I lost your Snooping Bug.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, that's all right,\\\" said the Fairy Godmother. \\\"Any time you'd like\\r\\nto borrow my Crying Bug or my Sulking Bug, just help yourself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No-thank-you,\\\" replied Prince. \\\"_NO-thank-you!_ No more bugs for me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                            THE WRONG JACK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are lots and lots of boys named Jack and some of them have been\\r\\nquite celebrated, like the Jack who planted the famous beanstalk. But\\r\\nthe Jack this story is about was just a bright, jolly little fellow who\\r\\nlived in a country home with his father and mother, and who had never\\r\\nhad any adventures more exciting than catching minnows in the creek or\\r\\ngetting stung by a hornet in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so you may be sure he was very much surprised to find himself in a\\r\\nterrific fix one summer morning as he was digging for worms back of the\\r\\nbarn where a wild grapevine grew. And this is how it happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time he wanted to go fishing he always dug for worms in the same\\r\\nplace, and as a consequence he had made quite a deep hole, but of\\r\\ncourse he never thought anything about _that_. Or at least he did\\r\\nnot until his spade struck something hard and a rumbling voice said:\\r\\n\\\"Ouch!\\\" And then the ground under his feet began to heave and heave,\\r\\nand before he could gather his wits and run away, out of the hole came\\r\\na giant, head first and scowling like anything. And even then Jack\\r\\ndid not run--he was too frightened. He just stayed where he was and\\r\\ntrembled.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Out of the hole came a giant]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So,\\\" said the giant, rubbing a lump over his left eyebrow, \\\"you're the\\r\\nchap who thumped me, eh? What do you mean by such actions?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Noth--noth--nothing,\\\" stammered Jack. \\\"I--I--I didn't know you were in\\r\\nthere. I--I--I was digging for worms.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't believe it,\\\" growled the giant. \\\"You were digging to find out\\r\\nif I was dead. Well, I'm not, even if my fall did drive me underground.\\r\\nAnd now I'll thank you to hand over my magic harp, and my money bags,\\r\\nand my hen that lays the golden eggs.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I--I--I don't know what you're talking about,\\\" said Jack. \\\"I haven't\\r\\ngot your harp, or your hen, or your money bags. All I've got is a can\\r\\nof worms and a fishing line. You must have mistaken me for somebody\\r\\nelse.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hum!\\\" said the giant, looking at him sharply, \\\"well, maybe I have.\\r\\nWhat is your name?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" answered the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Jack,\\\" bellowed the giant. \\\"Did you say Jack?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why, yes,\\\" replied our hero. \\\"What--what of it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What of it?\\\" repeated the monster, \\\"why everything of it. You tell\\r\\nme your name is Jack and yet you say you don't know anything about my\\r\\nharp, or my hen, or my money bags. I suppose you'll say next you didn't\\r\\ncut down the beanstalk and almost make me break my neck?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never,\\\" shouted Jack, \\\"I never did. I never had a beanstalk. It was\\r\\nthat other Jack in the story. You needn't blame it on me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he said it so earnestly the giant hesitated. \\\"Well,\\\" he grumbled,\\r\\nscratching his head and frowning at the boy, \\\"I may be wrong but it\\r\\nseems very queer that your name should be Jack also. And it seems even\\r\\nqueerer that you should be digging in the exact spot where I fell down\\r\\nthe beanstalk. Hang it all, I don't know what to think.\\\" Then suddenly\\r\\nhe clapped his hands together like thunder. \\\"I know what I'll do, I'll\\r\\ntake you back home and ask my wife. She has a wonderful memory for\\r\\nfaces and she can tell if any one can.\\\" And with that he caught up Jack\\r\\nand commenced to climb the grapevine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried the boy, peering out of the pocket where the giant had\\r\\ntucked him, \\\"this isn't a beanstalk, this is a grapevine and it isn't\\r\\nvery strong. You'll have another fall if you don't look out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I can't help it,\\\" said the giant, \\\"I must find my wife.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd he went on climbing, and climbing, and climbing, which much\\r\\nsurprised Jack for he had no idea the grapevine was so high, and he\\r\\nhad thought sure it would break when the giant got upon it. But it\\r\\ndid nothing of the sort, and at last they came to the end and found\\r\\nthemselves standing before the giant's house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said the giant, \\\"we'll soon find out whether you're the wrong\\r\\nJack or not.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they reached the front door he gave a shout, for there he saw\\r\\na sign which said:\\r\\n\\r\\n                                TO LET\\r\\n\\r\\nand found that all the shutters were shut and not a soul about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Zounds!\\\" yelled the monster, \\\"what _is_ the matter, and where is\\r\\neverybody? And what does 'to let' mean?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why,\\\" said Jack, crawling out of the giant's pocket and sliding down\\r\\nhis leg to the ground, \\\"I think it means that your house is for rent to\\r\\nanybody that wants it. Your wife must have moved away.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What?\\\" bawled the giant, \\\"my wife gone and my house left for any one\\r\\nthat wants it? Oh, wait until I catch her!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he stamped his feet and tore his beard, and carried on something\\r\\ndreadfully, until he had to sit down on the grass to get his breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he said, after a pause, \\\"the only thing to do is to hunt until\\r\\nwe find her, for I can't find out whether you're the wrong Jack until\\r\\nshe sees you. So come along and we'll see if the neighbors can tell us\\r\\nanything.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon he set off across the country with Jack running by his side\\r\\nuntil presently they came to a tumble-down cottage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Here is where Goog, the ogress lives,\\\" said the giant. \\\"She belonged\\r\\nto the same sewing circle as my wife so maybe she knows where she is.\\\"\\r\\nAnd he knocked at the cottage door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why, hello, Blunderbuss!\\\" exclaimed the ogress, smiling a very bristly\\r\\nsort of a smile as she answered the summons. \\\"Where did you come from?\\r\\nI thought you were dead.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed,\\\" said Blunderbuss, \\\"and I suppose my wife thought the same\\r\\nthing and that is the reason she has locked up my house and marked it\\r\\n'to let.'\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Exactly,\\\" replied Goog. \\\"She waited and waited after you fell down the\\r\\nbeanstalk and then decided you had broken your neck. So she closed the\\r\\nhouse, sold the family jewels to get spending money, and then started\\r\\nout to enjoy herself for once in her life.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Started out to enjoy herself,\\\" repeated the giant. \\\"That's a nice way\\r\\nfor a lady to act when she thinks her husband has broken his neck. And\\r\\nwhere is she now, pray?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I couldn't say,\\\" replied the ogress. \\\"Seeing as we belonged to the\\r\\nsame sewing circle I invited her here, but she just sniffed and said\\r\\nshe had no use for the lower classes now, so I guess she is cutting up\\r\\nhigh jinks somewhere.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Scandalous!\\\" said the giant, \\\"but I am not going to give up searching\\r\\nuntil I find her, for I want to know whether this boy is the one who\\r\\nplanted the beanstalk and took my things. He says his name is Jack, but\\r\\nbeyond that I can't be sure, but I think my wife could tell the moment\\r\\nshe saw him, she has such a fine memory. Good morning.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they bade the ogress good-by and resumed their travels until\\r\\npresently, as they rounded a bend in the road, they saw before them a\\r\\ntowering castle of brass, all gleaming in the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This,\\\" said Blunderbuss, \\\"is the house of the Duke of Dishwater,\\r\\nand I'm going to see if my wife is here, for although he is very,\\r\\nvery swell, he is also very, very poor, and it is quite possible that\\r\\nMrs. Blunderbuss with all that spending money, has been able to break\\r\\nthrough his reserve and get invited for the week end.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that he struck the castle gate a blow with his fist and it swung\\r\\nopen admitting them to a huge courtyard where the Duke, an exceedingly\\r\\nhaughty looking gentleman with a Roman nose and a ruff about his neck,\\r\\nstood waiting for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"How do you do?\\\" cried the giant, \\\"is my wife here? If she is I'll pull\\r\\nyour castle up by the roots and twirl it around my head. If she isn't,\\r\\nI'll have to hunt elsewhere. Hurry up, say what you've got to say. I\\r\\nhave no time to lose.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why--well--well--\\\" stammered the Duke, \\\"I--I--I think under the\\r\\ncircumstances I had better say she is _not_ here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said the giant, \\\"then I'll be trotting along, but I'll\\r\\nleave this boy with you. Put him in your safe deposit box, for when I\\r\\nfind my wife I'll have need of him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen kicking the gate open again he strode through it and down the road\\r\\nout of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment the Duke of Dishwater looked at Jack, and Jack looked at\\r\\nthe Duke of Dishwater. After which the nobleman took off his wig and\\r\\nmopped his head nervously with his handkerchief. \\\"My, my,\\\" he said,\\r\\nfretfully, \\\"whoever heard of pulling one's castle up by the roots.\\r\\nWretched taste, I call it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Jack, \\\"he won't do it if Mrs. Blunderbuss isn't here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quite so,\\\" said the Duke, \\\"but Mrs. Blunderbuss _is_ here. She has\\r\\nbeen visiting us for a week.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Jack, severely, \\\"you told a fib.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not a regular fib, no sir-ee,\\\" replied the Duke, \\\"I only said 'under\\r\\nthe circumstances' I had better say she wasn't here, so he wouldn't\\r\\npull my castle up. And now the next thing is to see she isn't here when\\r\\nhe comes back. Excuse me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that he rushed indoors and yelled for _his_ wife to tell the\\r\\ngiant's wife to pack up her things and go away right off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the Duchess told Mrs. Blunderbuss as politely as she could\\r\\nthat it was time for her to go home, the giant's wife was perfectly\\r\\nfurious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never in all my life have I been so insulted,\\\" she cried. \\\"The idea of\\r\\ninviting a person to pay you a visit and then telling her to go home.\\r\\nWell, I'm not going to do it. I'll stay here whether you want me or\\r\\nnot.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said the Duke of Dishwater, \\\"you don't understand. Your husband\\r\\nis hunting for you and if he finds you here he'll pull my castle up by\\r\\nthe roots.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What do I care about your old castle,\\\" snapped Mrs. Blunderbuss. \\\"And\\r\\nanyway, he couldn't because he's deader than a doornail; so there.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, no, he isn't,\\\" put in Jack. \\\"You may think he is, but he isn't.\\r\\nThat fall down the beanstalk only stunned him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then he told the giant's wife how he had dug Blunderbuss out and\\r\\nhow the giant had brought him back because he thought that Jack was\\r\\nthe boy who had run off with his property. \\\"And,\\\" went on the boy, \\\"he\\r\\nwon't believe I am the wrong Jack until you tell him so. And of course\\r\\nyou can see I am the wrong Jack, can't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Maybe I can, and maybe I can't,\\\" said Mrs. Blunderbuss, crossly.\\r\\n\\\"Anyway it's your fault he has come back and that's enough for me to\\r\\nworry about without worrying to remember whether you're the wrong Jack\\r\\nor the right one, I reckon.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd having made that announcement she marched upstairs to her room with\\r\\nher nose in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My gracious,\\\" gasped Jack, \\\"if that isn't the meanest thing I ever\\r\\nheard of.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Duke, \\\"you needn't scowl at me. 'Taint my fault!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, taking out his snuff box, the Duke of Dishwater helped himself to\\r\\na generous pinch and marched upstairs with _his_ nose in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, as you can see, this left Jack in a very unhappy frame of mind,\\r\\nfor how in the world was he ever going to get back home unless he could\\r\\nprove to Blunderbuss that he was not the Jack who had planted the\\r\\nbeanstalk? And the more he thought about the matter the more perplexing\\r\\nit seemed, so finally he decided to run away and try to find the place\\r\\nwhere the grapevine grew up to the giant's house, and then climb down\\r\\nit quickly before the giant came back.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when the Duke called downstairs to tell him to hurry and get in the\\r\\nsafe deposit box, he said \\\"all right,\\\" but instead of going upstairs\\r\\nhe slipped out the front door into the courtyard. Then, while the\\r\\nman-at-arms on guard was busily talking to one of the scullery maids,\\r\\nhe softly unbolted the gate and ran off as fast as he could. All that\\r\\nday he traveled back over the road he had come with the giant, and\\r\\nthen when he reached the cottage of Goog, the ogress, although he knew\\r\\nit was very dangerous to do so, he could not resist peeking in at the\\r\\nwindow. And there she was, uglier than ever, stirring the big pot over\\r\\nthe fire and singing in a horrible cracked voice: and this is what she\\r\\nsang:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Oh, Jack, he took the money bags\\r\\n      I don't know where they are.\\r\\n    And Jack he took the giant's harp\\r\\n      And carried it afar.\\r\\n    And Jack he took the magic hen\\r\\n      But when it was unloosed,\\r\\n    It did what every chicken does,\\r\\n      It came back home to roost.\\r\\n\\r\\n    And when I want some golden eggs--\\r\\n      (Real solid gold--I weigh 'em)\\r\\n    I go to Blunderbuss's house\\r\\n      And get his hen to lay 'em.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then chuckling, she put on her bonnet, and took her stick and\\r\\ncame out of her cottage door, not noticing Jack peering around the\\r\\ncorner. And away she went over the hill to the giant's house. When she\\r\\ngot there she pulled open a shutter and climbed in, after which she\\r\\nscattered corn over the floor, and presently into the room scampered\\r\\nthe magic hen and after it had eaten the corn it began to lay one\\r\\ngolden egg after the other until the ogress had her apron full.\\r\\nAnd Jack, watching through the shutter, was awfully astonished and\\r\\nunderstood what she meant by singing about chickens coming home to\\r\\nroost. Evidently the stolen hen had come back and no one knew it but\\r\\nGoog, and she was getting rich on the eggs it laid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My,\\\" said Jack to himself, \\\"wouldn't the giant be mad if he knew?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when the ogress had gone back to her cottage to put away her golden\\r\\neggs, Jack pulled open the shutter and climbed into the room where the\\r\\nmagic hen was going about clucking proudly because she had laid so many\\r\\neggs. And before the hen knew what was going to happen he grabbed her,\\r\\ntucked her under his arm, climbed out of the window again and ran off\\r\\nto see if he could find where the grapevine was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gee whiz!\\\" he chuckled, \\\"if I can only get home with this hen we'll be\\r\\nso rich my father won't have to work again. We can have automobiles and\\r\\nsteam yachts and everything.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then all of a sudden he remembered that the hen did not belong to\\r\\nhim and that if he took it he would be stealing, so after thinking\\r\\nover the matter a moment he decided it would not do and turned back to\\r\\nthe giant's house to replace what he had taken. But before he had gone\\r\\nhalf way he heard a trampling sound and saw the giant coming toward him\\r\\ncarrying the Duke's castle in his hand with the roots of it dragging on\\r\\nthe ground, and with the Duke, and the Duchess, and Mrs. Blunderbuss\\r\\nhanging out of the windows, wailing and wringing their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuick as a wink Jack thrust the hen beneath his blouse, and presently\\r\\nthe giant stood towering over him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So,\\\" shouted Blunderbuss, dropping the castle to the ground with a\\r\\nbang, \\\"you ran away, did you? Well, now, I think I'll give every one\\r\\nof you to the ogress to put in her pot. And I think,\\\" he continued,\\r\\nlooking at Jack more closely, \\\"that you'll please her especially, for\\r\\nyou certainly are fatter than when I saw you last.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Jack, feeling dreadfully frightened, but trying his\\r\\nbest not to show it, \\\"do as you like, but if you do you'll be sorry,\\r\\nfor I know where your magic hen is and I shan't tell you if you give me\\r\\nto the ogress.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" shouted the giant, \\\"where is my hen?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then Jack told him how he had followed the ogress and watched her\\r\\ntake the golden eggs, and maybe the giant was not furious when he heard\\r\\n_that_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Right in my own house,\\\" he bellowed. \\\"Well, it won't take me long to\\r\\nget my hen _now_.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Jack, coolly, \\\"your hen isn't there. I took her away and hid\\r\\nher, and when you let me go home, and when you forgive your wife, and\\r\\nwhen you replant the castle, I'll give her back, but not before.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd having said that, he remarked \\\"ho, hum,\\\" whirled about on his heel\\r\\nand whistled carelessly as though he did not care whether the giant\\r\\naccepted his offer or not, but of course he did care, and so did the\\r\\nDuke, and his wife, and Mrs. Blunderbuss, but when they saw Jack let\\r\\non that _he_ did not care, they let on, too, and said \\\"ho, hum\\\" and\\r\\nwhirled about and whistled, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course when the giant noticed that apparently nobody cared a\\r\\nwhoop what he did or what he did not do, he did just what they wanted\\r\\nhim to do, and promised everything Jack asked, in order to get back his\\r\\nmagic hen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very good,\\\" said Jack, \\\"then here she is.\\\" And opening his blouse he\\r\\npulled out the giant's property and handed it to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ho, ho,\\\" growled the giant, \\\"so that's what made you so fat, eh? Well,\\r\\nI suppose there's nothing to do but to tell you where the grapevine is.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All you have to do,\\\" he said, \\\"is to climb straight down and you'll be\\r\\nhome in ten minutes, but before you start I wish you would come with\\r\\nme to the ogress's cottage so I can have proof when I accuse her of\\r\\nstealing the golden eggs my hen laid.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Jack, and the Duke and the Duchess, and Mr. and Mrs. Blunderbuss\\r\\nhurried off to where Goog lived, and the giant, pointing to Jack, told\\r\\nthe ogress what the boy had seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And now,\\\" he bawled, angrily, \\\"you'll just hand back those eggs and\\r\\nhand 'em back quick.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Dear me,\\\" replied the ogress, \\\"I'm awfully sorry, but they're all in\\r\\nthe pot boiling. Look in and you can see for yourself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the giant bent over the sizzling pot she gave him a push and\\r\\nin he went head over heels. \\\"Ouch!\\\" he roared, trying to jump out of\\r\\nthe scalding water.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, you don't,\\\" shrieked Goog.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when she tried to push him back he grabbed her and bing--into the\\r\\npot went the ogress also, and in about four minutes both the giant and\\r\\nthe ogress were stewing and steaming, and boiling, and that was the end\\r\\nof them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when Jack saw that, he thought it was time for him to leave, so he\\r\\nstole away to where the grapevine grew and climbed down it as quickly\\r\\nas he could. And you may be sure when he got to the bottom he took the\\r\\nax and chopped down the grapevine just like the other Jack chopped down\\r\\nthe beanstalk.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                       THE SECOND STORY BROTHERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo doubt you will think this story begins in a very strange place when\\r\\nyou learn that it starts on board a Chinese junk or ship, as it sailed\\r\\nup a muddy Chinese river on its way to the city of Ki Yi.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow most Chinese ships are dingy and dirty but this particular junk\\r\\nwas just the opposite. Its sails were new, its decks neat and clean,\\r\\nand all because it carried a mandarin of high rank on his way to a\\r\\nwedding feast in the distant town. Very fat this mandarin was, and\\r\\nvery smiling, and the wedding presents he carried were enormously\\r\\nvaluable--gold and silver, and silks and jewels--packed away in his\\r\\ncabin; and the sight of them made the mouths of the captain and crew\\r\\nwater. So finally the sailors and their commander determined to throw\\r\\nthe mandarin overboard and take the presents for themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, as Chinese people are always polite, no matter what the\\r\\ncircumstances, instead of going below and seizing him without another\\r\\nword, they sent the cabin boy, Dong, down with a note requesting the\\r\\npleasure of the mandarin's presence on deck at once and expressing\\r\\ntheir deep regret that they would have to put an end to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ahem!\\\" remarked the mandarin, as he finished reading the note, \\\"how\\r\\nvery kind of them.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen looking over his horn spectacles he examined Dong, the cabin boy,\\r\\nas he stood before him. \\\"I'm awfully sorry,\\\" he said, \\\"that a boy like\\r\\nyou--you can't be more than seven--and such a nice looking boy, too,\\r\\nshould join in such a wicked conspiracy. How would you like to be\\r\\ndrowned?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDong shook his head. \\\"I wouldn't like it,\\\" he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No more do I,\\\" replied the mandarin, \\\"and yet, unless you save me, I\\r\\nshall be.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Dong, \\\"how can I save you? I would if I could, but I am\\r\\nonly a boy.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That makes no difference,\\\" said the mandarin; \\\"if you are a brave boy,\\r\\nyou can do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he handed Dong a large fan and told him to go up on deck and fan\\r\\nthe captain and the crew with three big sweeps and they would dissolve\\r\\nlike mist. \\\"I'd do it myself,\\\" he continued, \\\"but I'm afraid they'd\\r\\nseize me before I could get a chance to do it and throw me overboard.\\r\\nBut of course they will not suspect you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dong, trembling with excitement, took the fan and climbed the ladder\\r\\nto the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" asked the captain of the junk, \\\"is the mandarin coming?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" replied Dong, opening the fan with a jerk, \\\"he is not. He\\r\\ndeclines your invitation and says he prefers to remain in his cabin\\r\\nwith the wedding presents.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, he does, does he!\\\" bawled the captain. \\\"That's what we get for\\r\\nbeing polite.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he shouted for the crew to follow him and started for the\\r\\nmandarin's cabin, but Dong, all ready with the fan open, quickly\\r\\nstepped in front of him, gave three big sweeps, and pish! the captain\\r\\nand the entire crew of the junk disappeared completely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gracious!\\\" gasped the boy, closing the fan quickly for fear he might\\r\\nfan himself, \\\"wasn't that awful?\\\" Then he ran down to the cabin and\\r\\ntold the mandarin what he had done.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" exclaimed the mandarin, in a tone of great satisfaction, rubbing\\r\\nhis hands together, \\\"I'm very glad to hear it, and I'm sure they are\\r\\nbetter off where they are, wherever they are. And now let me have my\\r\\nfan back, please.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the moment he got his fan back he stood up very straight and\\r\\nrapped the palm of his right hand once with it, and to Dong's amazement\\r\\nthere appeared at his right side another man exactly like him. Then he\\r\\nrapped the palm of his left hand twice and there appeared at his left\\r\\nside another man exactly like him. Whereupon the three men bowed to\\r\\neach other affably and then shook hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Permit me,\\\" said the mandarin, \\\"to introduce my two brothers, Sin\\r\\nSum Tu and Sin Sum Wen. My name is Sin Sum. And while I am explaining\\r\\nthings to you let me say that I am _not_ a mandarin; that I am _not_\\r\\non my way to a wedding; and that the goods I have are _not_ wedding\\r\\npresents.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What,\\\" exclaimed Dong, \\\"not a mandarin and not going to a wedding?\\r\\nThen what are you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I--that is, we,\\\" replied the supposed mandarin, \\\"are the Second Story\\r\\nBrothers, the cleverest porch climbers in China. In other words we are\\r\\nrobbers, and famous ones, too. Why we've even written a song about\\r\\nourselves. It goes like this.\\\" Throwing back his head he sang and his\\r\\nbrothers joined in:\\r\\n\\r\\n              The sailor sings of the ocean blue,\\r\\n              For that is the proper thing to do.\\r\\n              The soldier sings of the battles fought\\r\\n              With a hip hurrah as a soldier ought.\\r\\n              But, oh, our song it beats all others--\\r\\n              The song of the Second Story Brothers--\\r\\n              And this is the way the ditty closes\\r\\n              As we sing it softly through our noses:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Look out for your money bags and diamond studded pin, sir.\\r\\n    Look out, for the outlook is that some night we'll look in, sir.\\r\\n    Ask your fathers what to do, or better, ask your mothers.\\r\\n    Be prepared to guard against the Second Story Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Dong, when they had finished, \\\"I think it was a very mean\\r\\ntrick you played on me. See what I did to the captain and the crew\\r\\nbecause I thought you were a mandarin and they were going to rob you.\\r\\nAnd here you are, a robber yourself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quite true,\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"I admit it was a mean trick, but no meaner\\r\\nthan the captain was going to play on me. And as for yourself you can\\r\\nhave a much better job with us than you had before.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he told Dong that when the junk got to Ki Yi they were\\r\\ngoing to stay on it in the day time and at night they would rob the\\r\\nhouses of the wealthy people. \\\"And all you will have to do,\\\" he\\r\\ncontinued, \\\"is to remain in the cabin and sell the stolen property we\\r\\nbring you, to the various customers that call. Now how does that strike\\r\\nyou, my boy?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, sir,\\\" replied Dong, \\\"I shall not do it. I may be only a cabin\\r\\nboy, but I'm an honest one. I have no desire to become a robber.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But listen,\\\" put in the other two Second Story Brothers, \\\"think how\\r\\nfamous you may get to be. And if you should get caught and be beheaded,\\r\\nthey'd put your picture on souvenir postals, perhaps.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't care,\\\" said Dong, \\\"I'd rather make my living some other way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, you're not going to do it,\\\" snapped Sin Sum, angrily. \\\"You're\\r\\ngoing to make your living with us, and we're not going to coax you any\\r\\nlonger, either. And if you try to run away I'll fan you into nothing\\r\\nlike you did the captain and the crew.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Dong had no choice but to join the robbers, and the next night after\\r\\nthe vessel got to Ki Yi, Sin Sum made him go with him on a looting\\r\\nexpedition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I just want to show you how it is done,\\\" he said, \\\"in case one of us\\r\\ngets sick or something, so you can take his place.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he led the way ashore and presently Dong found himself standing\\r\\nbefore a handsome building surrounded by a high wall. \\\"This is the\\r\\nViceroy's palace,\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"and I am going to steal the family\\r\\njewels.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But how will you get over the wall?\\\" inquired the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, that's easy,\\\" replied Sin Sum. \\\"All I have to do is to fan a hole\\r\\nin it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo taking out his fan he waved it three times and instantly part of\\r\\nthe wall melted away. And then after they had passed through the gap\\r\\nhe fanned another hole in the front door, and in a jiffy they were\\r\\nupstairs in the Viceroy's bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" said the robber, \\\"when there is a porch I prefer to climb\\r\\nto the top of it as a second story man should, but when there is none I\\r\\njust fan my way in.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time he had fanned most of the bureau drawers open and in a\\r\\nmoment more had found the family jewels. Then having found them, he\\r\\nfanned them also, and pish! they disappeared, case and all.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Goodness,\\\" exclaimed Dong, \\\"now you _have_ done it. What did you\\r\\ndissolve them for?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSin Sum chuckled. \\\"Wait till we get back to the boat and I'll show you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the Viceroy and his wife began to toss about in their bed\\r\\nand it was evident that the conversation was beginning to awaken them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quick,\\\" said Dong, \\\"let's get out or they'll catch us.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Huh!\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"they'd better not. If they wake up and make any\\r\\nfuss, I'll give them a fanning they won't forget.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd no doubt he would have dissolved the regal couple without the\\r\\nslightest hesitation if Dong had not coaxed him out of the palace and\\r\\nback to the junk.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they got there they found that Sin Sum's two brothers, who had\\r\\nalso been out burglaring, had arrived before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"let's count up what we got to-night.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a little book from beneath his sash he turned the pages.\\r\\n\\\"H--I--J--jewels,\\\" he said. \\\"Let's see how many raps for jewels. Ah,\\r\\nhere it is, seven raps for jewels.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he rapped the palm of his hand seven times with his fan and the\\r\\nnext moment he was holding the casket containing the Viceroy's precious\\r\\nstones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he turned to his brother Sin Sum Tu. \\\"What did you get?\\\" he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gold, and lots of it,\\\" answered Sin Sum Tu.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Sin Sum looked in the book and found that it took five raps to\\r\\nproduce gold, whereupon Sin Sum Tu rapped _his_ hand with _his_ fan\\r\\nfive times, and a big pile of gold poured into it and spilled over on\\r\\nthe floor of the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now, Sin Sum Wen,\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"it's your turn. What have you got?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Sin Sum Wen, \\\"I hate to tell you but I got nothing but\\r\\npies and cakes. I broke into a baker's shop thinking to rob his cash\\r\\ndrawer, but I guess business was bad, for the drawer was empty, but\\r\\nrather than come away without anything, I fanned all his pies and\\r\\ncakes, although you may not think it worth while to produce them.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said Sin Sum, \\\"they are better than nothing. We can eat them\\r\\nfor supper.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took his book and found that pies and cakes required eleven\\r\\nraps, and Sin Sum Wen rapped _his_ hand eleven times with _his_ fan and\\r\\nin about twenty seconds there were enough refreshments in the cabin to\\r\\nlast a week.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said the Second Story Brothers, picking up the dainties and\\r\\npiling them on the table, \\\"now we _will_ have a feast.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that they started in and ate, and ate, and ate; lemon pie,\\r\\napple pie, cocoanut pie, cherry pie, chocolate cake, cinnamon bun,\\r\\njelly cake; in fact every kind of pie and cake a baker makes, and in\\r\\nabout an hour each of them had about every kind of a stomach ache that\\r\\nevery kind of a pie and cake makes, and were rolling around howling\\r\\nwith pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow Dong, while he had eaten some of the goodies had not eaten much,\\r\\nfor not being very happy he was not very hungry, so he was not made ill\\r\\nlike the others. And presently as he saw that they paid no attention to\\r\\nhim, he decided that here was his chance to run away. So he slipped\\r\\nout of the cabin and over the side of the boat, and made off into the\\r\\ncity as fast as he could to the police station, for he knew when the\\r\\nViceroy woke up and found his family jewels gone, there would be an\\r\\nawful row. And if he showed the police where to find them the Viceroy\\r\\ncould not punish him for being with Sin Sum when he stole them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he got to the police station, however, the officer at the door\\r\\ntold him that Ho Hum, the Chief of Police, was taking a nap and could\\r\\nnot be disturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" cried Dong, \\\"I can show you how to catch the Second Story\\r\\nBrothers who have stolen the Viceroy's family jewels, if you will come\\r\\nwith me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What!\\\" shouted the officer, \\\"they stole the Viceroy's jewels?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he ran off and wakened Ho Hum at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Waugh!\\\" yawned the Chief of Police, \\\"what is this I hear? The Second\\r\\nStory Brothers have stolen the Viceroy's jewels and you will show us\\r\\nhow to catch them?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Dong, \\\"but you'd better hurry up before they find out that\\r\\nI have come to tell you about it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Ho Hum, the Chief of Police, and a number of his officers strapped\\r\\non their roller skates and with Dong hurried off to the boat where the\\r\\nSecond Story Brothers were just recovering from the effects of the\\r\\nstolen pies and cakes. And very pale and miserable they looked sitting\\r\\nagainst the cabin wall when the police burst in and confronted them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Surrender!\\\" shouted Ho Hum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Quick!\\\" cried Dong, \\\"take their fans from them or it will be the worse\\r\\nfor you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHo Hum, the Chief of Police, scowled. \\\"See here, boy,\\\" he said, \\\"are\\r\\nyou the Chief of Police or am I? The idea of telling me what to do!\\r\\nWhy, I was arresting folks before you were born.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" began Dong, \\\"won't you please listen, I--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" bawled the Chief of Police.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Good for you, old sleepy head,\\\" shouted the Second Story Brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they leaped to their feet, gave three waves of their three fans,\\r\\nand pish!--Ho Hum and all of his officers disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Sin Sum, grinning wickedly as he turned to Dong, \\\"we'll\\r\\nattend to you, my son. We'll teach you how to go off and tell the\\r\\npolice about us.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Shall we fan him into nothing?\\\" asked Sin Sum Tu and Sin Sum Wen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not yet,\\\" replied Sin Sum, \\\"not until I've laid him across my knee for\\r\\nabout five minutes and given him something to remember me by.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that he made a rush for Dong, but Dong, half scared out of his\\r\\nwits, dived under the table, then behind the chairs here and there like\\r\\na squirrel, and Sin Sum, who was fat and short winded, could not catch\\r\\nhim. Then his two brothers joined in, but they were even fatter, and\\r\\nbesides the pies and cakes they had just stuffed had left them in no\\r\\ncondition to run a race, so do what they would they could not catch\\r\\nthe boy. And Dong, seeing that they could not, began to grow bolder,\\r\\nand presently, as Sin Sum made a violent grab at him he also made a\\r\\ngrab at Sin Sum and snatched his fan and his book from his sash. Then\\r\\nlike lightning he turned and whipped the fan open, gave three quick\\r\\nsweeps with it at the robbers, and pish!--they disappeared as neatly as\\r\\nthe police had, and Dong was left the sole occupant of the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: He turned and whipped the fan open]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Gee whiz!\\\" he exclaimed, all out of breath, but nevertheless highly\\r\\npleased with himself, \\\"I did for them that time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he opened Sin Sum's producing book, found the page where it said\\r\\n\\\"police\\\" required four raps, and rapping the palm of his hand four\\r\\ntimes, Ho Hum and his officers appeared once more, looking rather pale\\r\\nand nervous after their strange experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Dong to the Chief, \\\"I guess you wish you had done as I\\r\\ntold you and taken the fans away from those robbers.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHo Hum rolled his eyes. \\\"Don't say a word,\\\" he replied. \\\"I feel like\\r\\narresting myself, missing such a fine chance to capture the Second\\r\\nStory Brothers. Dear me, I'm afraid I'll never catch them now.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, yes, you will,\\\" said Dong. \\\"Just you watch.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that he struck the palm of his right hand once with Sin Sum's fan,\\r\\nand instantly at his right hand stood Sin Sum Tu, and the moment he\\r\\nappeared Dong snatched his fan from him. Then he rapped his left hand\\r\\nwith Sin Sum's fan twice and instantly at his left side stood Sin Sum\\r\\nWen, and Dong quickly snatched his fan also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" he said to the robbers, \\\"tell me how to produce Sin Sum or I'll\\r\\nfan you both into nothing again.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the robbers told Dong to rap his forehead once with the fan and Sin\\r\\nSum would appear. And sure enough, the moment Dong rapped his forehead,\\r\\nthere before him stood Sin Sum. And the next moment Ho Hum and his\\r\\nofficers pounced on the Second Story Brothers and tied them securely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen everybody set off for the Viceroy's palace, Dong carefully\\r\\ncarrying the stolen jewels. By the time they got there it was morning\\r\\nand the Viceroy and his wife having just come down to breakfast, were\\r\\nlistening to the butler tell them how the front door had a hole in it\\r\\nand that he guessed some one had been in the house the night before.\\r\\nBut not until Dong and the police and the Second Story Brothers entered\\r\\nthe dining room and Dong had handed over the jewels, did they know they\\r\\nhad been stolen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Suffering chopsticks!\\\" shouted the Viceroy; \\\"to think of my house\\r\\nbeing robbed. Some one shall suffer for this!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he said that he looked straight at the Second Story Brothers,\\r\\nwhich made their knees knock together very much for they knew of course\\r\\nhe was talking about them, and they did not like the way he pronounced\\r\\nthe word \\\"suffer\\\" at all. Then having put the captured robbers in a\\r\\nfirst class uncomfortable frame of mind, the Viceroy turned to Ho Hum,\\r\\ngrasped him by the hand and called him a hero.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Stop!\\\" interrupted the Chief of Police, \\\"I cannot let you say that.\\r\\nNo one enjoys being a hero more than I, but the blood of my truthful\\r\\nancestors compels me to state that the boy who stands before you is the\\r\\nonly hero in this affair. If it had not been for him the whole police\\r\\nforce would be nowhere.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon he told the Viceroy how Dong had brought them back after the\\r\\nrobbers had made them disappear, and also brought the robbers back so\\r\\nthey could be arrested.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, well,\\\" exclaimed the Viceroy, giving Dong a most admiring\\r\\nglance, \\\"if that isn't just like something you read about. If we only\\r\\nhad more boys like you in China, China might amount to something. Hum!\\r\\nHow would you like to be adopted?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I shouldn't mind,\\\" replied Dong.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo right then and there the Viceroy of Ki Yi adopted Dong into his\\r\\nfamily, and told him if he minded his P's and Q's--particularly his\\r\\nQ's--he might be Viceroy himself some day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the chances are if you visit China in the years to come you may\\r\\nfind that Dong _has_ become Viceroy, for you must admit that if he was\\r\\nsmart enough to put an end to the career of the Second Story Brothers,\\r\\nhe was certainly smart enough to become a Viceroy or even something\\r\\nbetter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                         THE IMAGINARY ISLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning the Emperor Fuss of Fizz sat on the front porch of his\\r\\npalace rocking impatiently back and forth. Evidently he was waiting for\\r\\nsomebody. By and by when he had rocked so many times his rocking chair\\r\\nwas beginning to squeak, the royal necromancer, Wist the Wise, an aged\\r\\ngentleman wearing a gorgeous gown of office, came hurrying up the royal\\r\\navenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ha!\\\" exclaimed the Emperor, \\\"so you've come at last, have you? It's\\r\\nlucky for you that I'm a good natured monarch.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm awfully sorry to have kept you waiting, your majesty,\\\" replied the\\r\\nnecromancer, bowing low, \\\"but the commander-in-chief of your army had a\\r\\ntoothache, and I had to wish the tooth out for him and believe me, it\\r\\nwas some job.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Emperor, \\\"you have a harder job than that before you.\\r\\nMy son, Prince Frip, has been reading about desert islands and insists\\r\\non having one at once to discover. So get to work, for as you know\\r\\nwhatever Frip wants he wants with all his might.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, Wist the Wise knew it only too well. A good part of his time he\\r\\nwas kept busy exercising his magic arts to provide amusement for Prince\\r\\nFrip, who was a very lively young person, and who got tired of a thing\\r\\nalmost as soon as he got it. As a consequence the wizard had often\\r\\nwished he might get rid of the boy forever, for he was afraid that some\\r\\nday Frip would ask for something he would be unable to give him, for\\r\\neven a magician has his limits. So this time the royal necromancer was\\r\\ndetermined to fix the Prince so he would not bother him any more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Did you say an island, your majesty?\\\" he inquired of the Emperor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I did,\\\" replied the monarch, \\\"and a desert island, too, with plenty of\\r\\nstrange and wonderful things on it to interest a boy. I want to keep\\r\\nFrip busy this time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said the wizard, grimly. \\\"But as you know, your majesty, the\\r\\nkingdom of Fizz is far inland, and desert islands are only found in\\r\\nthe sea. If you want desert islands, you must go where desert islands\\r\\nbloom.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, I must, must I?\\\" retorted the Emperor, angrily. \\\"Whom do you think\\r\\nyou're talking to? You have that desert island ready for Frip to play\\r\\nwith to-morrow morning, or I'll have you made into an Irish stew.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe royal necromancer shuddered. \\\"Well,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll do my best, but\\r\\nwhether you stew me or not, I simply cannot provide an out and out,\\r\\nreally true island. At the best it will only be an imaginary one. Will\\r\\nthat do?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't care what it is,\\\" said the monarch, \\\"so long as the Prince can\\r\\nlose himself on it for a while and not bother me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the next morning when Prince Frip commenced to ask when he was going\\r\\nto get the desert island he had been wishing for, the Emperor was\\r\\nable to tell him he would have it that very day. And when the royal\\r\\nnecromancer made his appearance a short time afterward, the prediction\\r\\ncame true. Leading the Prince out upon the palace lawn, the wizard\\r\\nplaced him with his face towards the east. Then Wist the Wise rolled\\r\\nup the right sleeve of his gown and began whirling his arm around and\\r\\naround as though he was going to throw something. After he had done\\r\\nthis about a hundred times he stopped all of a sudden with his finger\\r\\npointing straight ahead of him, and told the Prince to look and tell\\r\\nhim what he saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Prince Frip did not trouble to tell the royal necromancer anything.\\r\\nHe just gave one joyful yell and set off toward the pebbly beach that\\r\\nhad appeared in front of him. A beach flooded with sunshine and with\\r\\na shimmering sea beyond--blue in some spots and green in others--and\\r\\nwith a most delightfully mysterious looking island showing on the\\r\\nhorizon. Drawn up on the beach was a jaunty little sail boat. With\\r\\na vigorous push the Prince had the boat into deep water. Into the\\r\\ncraft he tumbled. Puff, puff, came a stiff and salty breeze. The\\r\\nsail flattened, the boat heeled over, and in a moment was cutting its\\r\\nway through the dancing waves with the Prince sitting at the rudder,\\r\\nsmiling as he had not smiled for many a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut had he known what the royal necromancer had done, he would have\\r\\nbeen frowning instead of smiling, for Wist the Wise when he told the\\r\\nEmperor that he could not provide a real island, had not spoken the\\r\\ntruth. If he had conjured up a _real_ island only _certain_ things\\r\\ncould have happened on it. But on the imaginary island which he had\\r\\nprovided, _anything_ could happen. And when _anything_ can happen there\\r\\nare bound to be some very strange adventures. And so the wizard felt\\r\\npretty sure that Frip would have a tough time before he got back again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Prince, suspecting nothing, sat in the little sail boat\\r\\nas it went on and on, coming nearer and nearer to the island all the\\r\\nwhile, until finally he cast anchor in the prettiest little cove you\\r\\never saw, and taking off his shoes and stockings, waded ashore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My,\\\" he exclaimed, as he looked about, \\\"isn't this splendid!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the right and left of him the beach stretched away in a glittering\\r\\ncurve. It looked as though it might be made of gold dust instead of\\r\\nsand, and the reason it looked that way was because it _was_ made of\\r\\ngold dust. Tons and tons of gold dust were there, enough to buy out the\\r\\ngreatest millionaire in the world. But the Prince did not know it, and\\r\\nif he had known it he would not have cared, he was too busy watching\\r\\na short, squatty looking man with a dark brown complexion, driving a\\r\\nstake into the beach a short distance away, on which was a sign:\\r\\n\\r\\n    +-------------+\\r\\n    | REAL ESTATE |\\r\\n    |LOTS FOR SALE|\\r\\n    +-------------+\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the man had made the sign secure he turned about and saw Frip.\\r\\n\\\"Hello,\\\" he cried, coming toward him, \\\"when did you arrive?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Just now,\\\" said Frip. \\\"There's my boat.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said the man, \\\"so you came in a boat, eh? Very\\r\\ncommonplace--very. _I_ came on a Christmas tree.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you may think it was decidedly queer for a person to say such a\\r\\nthing as that, but the Prince did not, because when he was close to the\\r\\nstranger he saw he was nothing more or less than a Gingerbread Man,\\r\\nalthough unusually large for his species.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" went on the Gingerbread Man, \\\"I came on a Christmas tree, and I\\r\\ntell you it was rather exciting.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should think so,\\\" remarked Frip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course it was a mistake that I got overboard,\\\" said the Gingerbread\\r\\nMan. \\\"All they meant to do was to throw the Christmas tree overboard\\r\\nafter the celebration on the ocean liner. But I was fastened to the top\\r\\nand they forgot to take me off. Well, I floated for days and days and\\r\\nhad about decided to try and lose my reason to keep from going insane,\\r\\nwhen, without the slightest warning, up out of the sea, right under my\\r\\nnose, popped this island.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What do you mean 'popped this island'?\\\" asked the Prince. \\\"It didn't\\r\\nreally pop out of the ocean, did it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It certainly did,\\\" replied the Gingerbread Man. \\\"One moment I was\\r\\nstraining my eyes looking for an island, and the next moment there it\\r\\nwas.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" cried Frip, excitedly, \\\"it must have been just when the royal\\r\\nnecromancer created the island for me to play with.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he told the Gingerbread Man how Wist the Wise had made\\r\\nthe island by magic at the command of the Emperor. \\\"And,\\\" he went on,\\r\\n\\\"it was mighty lucky for you that I happened to ask my father for a\\r\\ndesert island, otherwise you might be floating about the sea yet.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, \\\"it certainly was and I cannot thank\\r\\nyou enough, for it not only saved my life, but it has given me a chance\\r\\nto go into business for myself.\\\" He pointed to the real estate sign.\\r\\n\\\"It seemed a shame for all this land to go to waste so I've marked it\\r\\nout into building lots, and as the different people are shipwrecked\\r\\nhere, as of course they will be, I'll sell them the lots. See?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Frip, \\\"I see. But suppose they won't buy the lots?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, firmly, \\\"they've got to get off the\\r\\nisland. Business is business. I found the place first and it belongs to\\r\\nme.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Belongs to you,\\\" cried the Prince. \\\"Well, I guess not. Why, it was\\r\\n'_made_' for me. Didn't I just tell you it was made for me?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, \\\"you told me, but that doesn't\\r\\nmake it so, does it? And I did get here first, you can't deny that.\\r\\nAnd findings are keepings, you can't deny that, either. And whoever\\r\\nwants to stay here has _got_ to buy a lot.\\\" And having made that\\r\\nannouncement, he turned on his heel and walked away, frowning like\\r\\nanything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I suppose,\\\" said the Prince to himself, \\\"he's mad at me now. But I\\r\\ndon't care if he is, the island is mine and whoever gets shipwrecked\\r\\nhere can stay if they want to, lots or no lots.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen _he_ turned on _his_ heel and walked away in the opposite\\r\\ndirection to that taken by the Gingerbread Man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow as you know an island is an island--it may be a round island, or\\r\\nan oblong island, or a square island--but if it is an island and you\\r\\nstart at a certain place on the seacoast and walk long enough, you are\\r\\nbound to come back to the very place where you started. And that is\\r\\nexactly what happened to Frip. After he left the Gingerbread Man he\\r\\nwent on walking, and walking, and walking, until after a bit he came to\\r\\na place that looked very familiar and he saw by the real estate sign\\r\\nthat it was the same spot he had started from, except that something\\r\\nhad happened to it, which was that a bonfire was burning there and that\\r\\nrunning round and around the fire was the Gingerbread Man. And my, how\\r\\nfine he did smell for the fire had warmed him enough to freshen him up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hello,\\\" said Frip, sniffing hungrily, \\\"what's the matter with you? My,\\r\\nyou do smell nice!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, I do, do I?\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, keeping on running, \\\"then I\\r\\nsuppose you'll join the cannibals and help eat me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Cannibals!\\\" exclaimed the Prince, \\\"what cannibals? I don't see any\\r\\ncannibals.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Perhaps not,\\\" replied the Gingerbread Man, \\\"but you can easily see\\r\\ntheir footprints on the beach, can't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure enough there were the prints of bare feet all about the\\r\\nbonfire, and now that Frip had noticed them he saw to his surprise that\\r\\nfresh footprints were being made all the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why--why--\\\" he began, very much startled, \\\"why--hey, is anybody here?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the minute he said that there was a blood-curdling yell and upon\\r\\nhis vision burst a band of coal-black savages with waving plumes on\\r\\ntheir heads and spears in their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Upon his vision burst a band of coal-black savages]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" he gasped, \\\"goodness gracious!\\\" Then turning about he started\\r\\nto run away as fast as he could, but when you are surrounded by\\r\\nsavages it is not so easy to run away, and presently Frip found himself\\r\\nrunning around and around the bonfire in the opposite direction to that\\r\\ntaken by the Gingerbread Man, each one of them pursued by a towering\\r\\ncannibal. And no one knows how long they might have kept it up if at\\r\\nlast the Gingerbread Man had not bumped into him, cracking himself\\r\\nbadly and almost knocking the Prince down. And at this the cannibals\\r\\nhowled with glee.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said the Cannibal Chief, as he watched Frip trying to get his\\r\\nbreath, \\\"perhaps you'll tell me why you ran so. Was it because we\\r\\nshocked you? I was afraid we would.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Frip, \\\"you certainly did sort of shock me. And then--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I knew it,\\\" said the other. \\\"That's the reason we make ourselves\\r\\ninvisible when strangers are about. We hate to shock folks. Listen.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    We always try with all our might\\r\\n    To keep completely out of sight\\r\\n    When folks like you, got up in style,\\r\\n    Come visiting this desert isle.\\r\\n    For well we know that we at best\\r\\n    Are far from being overdressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n    And so until we get a chance\\r\\n    To find a way to get some pants,\\r\\n    And maybe too, a fancy vest\\r\\n    And derby hats, and all the rest,\\r\\n    All we can do is weave a spell\\r\\n    And make ourselves invis-i-ble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That,\\\" said the Cannibal Chief, \\\"covers the case completely. In other\\r\\nwords, we're the most refined savages you ever met.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Frip, \\\"if you're so refined, what do you want to be\\r\\ncannibals for? And why do you wish to eat that poor Gingerbread Man?\\r\\nThat's not very refined.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not very refined--I admit it,\\\" responded the Cannibal Chief, \\\"but very\\r\\nnecessary, for meals come before manners. And speaking of meals, I was\\r\\nthinking of asking you to join us at dinner. We'll have the Gingerbread\\r\\nMan for dessert.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried Frip, \\\"I couldn't think of eating the Gingerbread Man,\\r\\nthough I must say he smells awfully good when he's warmed up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That's all right,\\\" said the Cannibal Chief, \\\"you won't have to eat the\\r\\nGingerbread Man, in fact, you won't be here to do it. We're going to\\r\\neat you first.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow if Frip had chanced to sit down on a hornet and the hornet had got\\r\\nmad about it, it would certainly have made him jump, but nothing to\\r\\nwhat the remarks of the Cannibal Chief did. Indeed they almost froze\\r\\nhim stiff and his eyes fairly popped out of his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Eh?\\\" he gasped--\\\"why--what--say--why you--you don't mean to eat--eat\\r\\n_me_?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If you will join us at dinner--yes,\\\" said the Cannibal Chief,\\r\\npolitely. \\\"But of course if you have another dinner engagement--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I have,\\\" put in Frip, hastily, \\\"I have a whole lot of 'em. And--and\\r\\nI'm not a bit hungry, so I simply _could not_ join you at dinner.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, supper then, or breakfast,\\\" responded the Cannibal Chief.\\r\\n\\\"We'll call it whatever you want. We'll even call it a little side\\r\\nsnack, if you wish. You surely can't have engagements for every one of\\r\\nthose things.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes, I have,\\\" said the Prince, desperately, edging away. \\\"I have\\r\\nengagements for everything, day and night. I haven't a second to spare.\\r\\nAnd besides, my father, the Emperor of Fizz, is waiting for me to take\\r\\na walk and if you stop me he'll--he'll put you in prison.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Pooh,\\\" put in the Gingerbread Man, suddenly, \\\"his father isn't here.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I didn't say he was,\\\" replied Frip, \\\"but he's waiting for me at home.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, at home, eh?\\\" said the Cannibal Chief. \\\"Well, that's quite another\\r\\nmatter. Lots of things are waiting at home. No doubt a taxicab is\\r\\nwaiting for your father outside his palace. And I dare say there's a\\r\\nwoodpile in your backyard waiting for you to do some chopping. And\\r\\nyour mother, no doubt, is waiting for you to come back. And the hired\\r\\ngirl is probably waiting on the table. But here, nothing waits. So\\r\\nyou and your friend, the Gingerbread Man, kindly back up against that\\r\\nreal estate sign and let the fire grill you a little. We don't care for\\r\\n_cold_ meals.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you can easily imagine in what frame of mind the Prince was when\\r\\nhe heard that. Here was a fine ending to his adventure. When he had\\r\\nasked for a desert island he had expected to have an exciting time of\\r\\nit but not this sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My, oh my!\\\" he groaned. \\\"I wish I had stayed at home and played with\\r\\nmy regular play-things and not asked for a desert island. This is what\\r\\ncomes of wanting something that isn't meant for boys.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, \\\"and this is what comes of landing on\\r\\nsomething that isn't meant for gingerbread men. I wish now I had stayed\\r\\non that Christmas tree.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Frip, as the cannibals pushed him back to back with the\\r\\nGingerbread Man, \\\"I'm sorry we quarreled over those building lots.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Don't mention it,\\\" said the Gingerbread Man, \\\"and _I'm_ sorry you are\\r\\ngoing to be eaten ahead of me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they shook hands solemnly, and the Gingerbread Man's hand was\\r\\nso soft and sticky that one of the fingers came off in Frip's clasp.\\r\\nAnd just for a moment Frip thought of eating it, for he had had no\\r\\nbreakfast that morning, and then shocked that he should think of such a\\r\\nthing, he tossed it away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next instant one of the cannibals picked it up. \\\"Yum, yum,\\\" he\\r\\nexclaimed as he took a bite. Then he passed the morsel on to another\\r\\nof the band, and before the finger had gone half around, the whole\\r\\ngroup of cannibals were simply wild over the delicious flavor of the\\r\\nGingerbread Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ow! Yow!\\\" they shrieked. \\\"Gibblety! Goody!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen with another shriek they all rushed at the poor Gingerbread Man\\r\\nand tearing him away from the horror stricken Prince, commenced to\\r\\ngobble him up as fast as they could. And because there was so little of\\r\\nhim and so many of them, each one of the cannibals fell to fighting\\r\\nthe other in order to get his share of the tempting meal. And long\\r\\nafter the last crumb of the Gingerbread Man had disappeared, they were\\r\\nstill fighting furiously, until, as cannibals when they start to fight\\r\\nnever know how to stop, they killed each other, and Frip was the only\\r\\nperson left alive on the beach of the desert island.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when that happened you may be sure it did not take him long to wade\\r\\nout to his boat and set sail for home, for he had had quite enough of\\r\\n_that_ place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hello,\\\" said the royal necromancer, feeling very much annoyed as the\\r\\nPrince landed on the imaginary shore in front of his father's palace,\\r\\n\\\"how on earth did you get back so soon? You should have stayed longer.\\r\\nYou've missed seeing a lot of things.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't care if I did,\\\" said Frip, \\\"for what I _did_ see was quite\\r\\nenough.\\\" And when he said that it seemed to him he could still hear the\\r\\nwhoops of the invisible cannibals as they scrambled for the crumbs of\\r\\nthe Gingerbread Man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, ho,\\\" said Wist the Wise, smiling cheerily, \\\"then you don't care\\r\\nfor imaginary islands, eh?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Frip, \\\"I don't. That is, I don't except in story books.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                           THE DANCING PEARL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dancing Pearl was the name of a beautiful lady, and she danced\\r\\nevery evening and Saturday afternoons in the palace of the Viceroy of\\r\\nChow Chow. That is, she did until the Hermit of Hong carried her off by\\r\\nstealth one night to his cave in the mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the Hermit of Hong hated crowds and conversation, but he adored\\r\\nmusic and dancing, and after he had stolen the Dancing Pearl he just\\r\\nused to sit and bang the cymbals while he smoked his water pipe and\\r\\nwatched the Dancing Pearl dance until it made his eyes swim. And he\\r\\nnever gave a thought to the way the Viceroy must feel at being deprived\\r\\nof his dancing girl. But if the Hermit did not dwell upon the matter,\\r\\nthe Viceroy did, and the minute he found the Dancing Pearl was gone,\\r\\nhe went to see the celebrated Mongolian wizard, Hoo Hoo, who had his\\r\\noffice on the main street of Chow Chow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he entered the wizard's office he was much disappointed to\\r\\nfind that the wizard had just gotten married and that his wife would\\r\\nnot let him take any case which had a lady in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm awfully sorry,\\\" said the wizard to the Viceroy, \\\"but as you are a\\r\\nmarried man yourself, you can easily understand my position.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course, of course,\\\" replied the Viceroy, impatiently, \\\"but that\\r\\ndoes not get me back my dancing girl, and I must have her back. There\\r\\nis no one like her. She is the poetry of motion and the soul of\\r\\necstasy. I'll give half my fortune to get her back.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, in that case,\\\" said Hoo Hoo, \\\"I'll have to take the job, for\\r\\nthe half of your fortune added to mine will make me a very rich man.\\r\\nBut I can only do the work by proxy--that is, my apprentice will have\\r\\nto do it under my direction--for I positively will not hurt my wife's\\r\\nfeelings, not even for the half of your fortune.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he struck a gong and into the room walked a bright looking boy\\r\\nabout eight years old with his pigtail neatly curled about his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Floo the wizard at work.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"This,\\\" said the wizard, \\\"is my apprentice, Floo. I'll put him on the\\r\\ncase.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not much,\\\" exclaimed the Viceroy. \\\"Why, he is only a boy. You seem to\\r\\nthink this affair of mine is mere child's play.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, no, I don't,\\\" said the wizard, \\\"and if you think Floo is a child,\\r\\nyou are very much mistaken. He has been taught his trade very, very\\r\\ncarefully. Why, he can even tell how many hairs there are in your\\r\\npigtail. Tell him, Floo.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Floo, after examining the Viceroy's pigtail for a few moments, told\\r\\nhim there were 3,672,491 hairs in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There,\\\" said the wizard, proudly, \\\"what do you think of that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said the Viceroy, \\\"how do I know he's right?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" responded the wizard, \\\"how do you know he's wrong? Have you\\r\\never counted the hairs in your pigtail, eh?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"N--o,\\\" said the Viceroy, slowly, \\\"but--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said the wizard, \\\"the less said the better.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Floo was picked out to solve the mystery of the disappearance of\\r\\nthe Dancing Pearl, and the first thing the wizard did was to give him\\r\\na list of people in Chow Chow that might have carried off the dancing\\r\\ngirl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"To save time,\\\" he said, \\\"you'd better turn 'em all into turnips at\\r\\nonce, and then tell 'em you'll turn 'em back again if they'll confess\\r\\ntheir crime.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut after Floo had turned all the people into turnips and told them\\r\\nhe would turn them back if they confessed, he found that every one of\\r\\nthem confessed without a moment's hesitation, which made things very\\r\\nconfusing, for when you transform a thousand persons and each one says\\r\\nhe stole a dancing girl when only one dancing girl was stolen, you do\\r\\nnot know what to think. So the wizard told Floo he had better give up\\r\\nthat line of investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" continued the wizard, \\\"the next thing is to know what to do?\\r\\nWhat do you think?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Floo, \\\"I believe it would be a good plan to pick out the\\r\\nperson you think would never do such a thing as steal a dancing girl\\r\\nand go after him. And after you find him you'll probably find he did\\r\\nit. That is the way it always happens in the story books I've read.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said Hoo Hoo, \\\"suppose we try it. But it's going to be a\\r\\ntough job, I'm afraid.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd indeed it was, for Floo and the wizard thought and thought until\\r\\ntheir heads ached trying to recall a person in Chow Chow who would not\\r\\ncare to steal the Viceroy's dancing girl, but at last Floo gave a shout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I have it,\\\" he cried. \\\"I know of one person nobody would ever suspect,\\r\\nand that is the Hermit of Hong. He hates everybody--ladies most of\\r\\nall--and the only thing he enjoys is being by himself. So if the story\\r\\nbooks are right he must be the one who carried off the Dancing Pearl.\\r\\nI think I'll go to see him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Go ahead, then,\\\" said the wizard. Then he handed Floo a book bound in\\r\\nleather. \\\"Here,\\\" he said, \\\"are a few simple instructions how to turn\\r\\nthings into other things. I would suggest that you turn the Hermit into\\r\\na lemon if you find it necessary. Good-by and good luck!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Floo set off for the Hermit's cave and when he got there he found,\\r\\nas you already know, that the Hermit of Hong _had_ stolen the Dancing\\r\\nPearl, and was enjoying himself immensely as he watched her whirl about.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: He watched her whirl about]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sir,\\\" demanded Floo, sternly, \\\"what do you mean by such behavior? I\\r\\nthought you were a hermit. And besides, don't you know that the Dancing\\r\\nPearl belongs to the Viceroy of Chow Chow?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hermit of Hong laughed scornfully as he put down his cymbals and\\r\\nlaid aside his pipe. \\\"Belongs to the Viceroy of Chow Chow? You mean,\\r\\n_did_ belong to the Viceroy of Chow Chow. She belongs to me now. And\\r\\nas for you, whoever you are, get out of my cave before I throw a toad\\r\\nat you.\\\" Then he clashed his cymbals again and the Dancing Pearl went\\r\\non with her dancing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you may think that Floo would have been discouraged to meet with\\r\\nsuch a reception, but such was not the case, for he had not been\\r\\ntrained by the celebrated Mongolian wizard for nothing. No sir-ee, it\\r\\ntook much more than that to discourage him. So all he did was to take\\r\\nout his book of instructions and look it over. Then he put some figures\\r\\ndown on a piece of paper, after which he wiggled his fingers a moment\\r\\nand stamped his foot, and the Hermit of Hong was transformed into a\\r\\nlarge and very yellow looking lemon. And the moment that happened the\\r\\nDancing Pearl stopped dancing and rushed up to Floo with a cry of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" she panted, all out of breath from her late exertions. \\\"I'm _so_\\r\\nglad you came. I'm completely worn out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should think so,\\\" said Floo. \\\"Have you been dancing ever since that\\r\\nold thing carried you off?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Dancing Pearl; \\\"not even stopping for meals.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Floo, \\\"just you rest yourself and then we'll start back to\\r\\nthe Viceroy's palace.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told the Dancing Pearl who he was and why Hoo Hoo had sent him.\\r\\n\\\"Of course,\\\" he continued, \\\"the wizard will make much more money than\\r\\nI will out of this job, but I think I'll get my salary raised anyhow.\\r\\nAnd if I keep on being successful as I have been this time, I shouldn't\\r\\nbe surprised if I made a big enough salary after awhile to get married.\\r\\nAnd if I ever get married I know who I'd like to marry.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he said that the Dancing Pearl hung her head and turned very\\r\\npink. \\\"Oh,\\\" she murmured, \\\"I'm much too old for you. I'm almost twelve.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What of it?\\\" cried Floo, \\\"I'm going on nine.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Dancing Pearl and the wizard's apprentice decided to get married\\r\\nas soon as Floo made enough money to support them, and they were so\\r\\ntaken up with their planning that they quite forgot the Hermit of\\r\\nHong who had been turned into a lemon. But if they had forgotten about\\r\\nthe Hermit, the Hermit had not forgotten about himself, and the minute\\r\\nFloo turned him into a lemon he began to turn himself into something\\r\\nelse. Of course what he would have liked to do best would have been to\\r\\nturn himself back into a hermit, but when you have been transformed\\r\\ninto something, you cannot turn yourself back into what you were first\\r\\nunless you have attended a college of magic. And as luck would have it,\\r\\nthe Hermit of Hong had never been to college, and what little magic he\\r\\nknew he had picked up himself. Therefore, the only thing he could do\\r\\nwas to turn himself into something worse than what he was. And as long\\r\\nas he could not be the Hermit of Hong and have the Dancing Pearl dance\\r\\nfor him, he decided he might as well get even by being transformed\\r\\ninto something that would stand in the way of Floo having the Dancing\\r\\nPearl, so he turned himself into a monstrous Grammarsaurus or ancient\\r\\nIff, for he knew if anything could stand in the way of a person doing\\r\\nsomething he wanted to, an Iff could, because an Iff not only stood in\\r\\nthe way but it had the most disconcerting eyes. Yes, indeed, its eyes\\r\\nmade you so dizzy after you had gazed into them a moment you fell down\\r\\nin a heap, whereupon the Grammarsaurus devoured you eagerly. But if\\r\\nyou did not look into the creature's eyes you were all right, for the\\r\\nGrammarsaurus could not eat anything unless it was perfectly still.\\r\\nYou see he had to keep his eyes shut while he was eating, because if\\r\\nhe looked at what he was eating it went around and around, and it is\\r\\nawfully hard to make a meal of anything that is going around and around.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut of course Floo and the Dancing Pearl knew nothing about ancient\\r\\nIffs and their habits. All they knew was that they adored each other\\r\\nand wanted to get married, and when the Hermit turned himself from a\\r\\nlemon into an immense creature that half filled the cavern, you may be\\r\\nsure they were very much startled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried the Dancing Pearl, as the Grammarsaurus gave a snort that\\r\\nmade the cave tremble, \\\"what's that?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What's what?\\\" asked Floo, turning about. And then when _he_ saw the\\r\\nancient Iff you can well believe he said \\\"oh\\\" also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My gracious,\\\" he gasped, \\\"how did that thing get in here? And--and\\r\\nwhere is the lemon I made out of the Hermit?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That,\\\" said the Grammarsaurus, icily, \\\"is a mystery that I can easily\\r\\nsolve. I am the hermit, likewise the lemon, and also something else\\r\\nbeside as you may observe.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should say you were,\\\" said the Dancing Pearl. \\\"I never saw such a\\r\\nmonster.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then as she looked into the creature's eyes she felt a slight\\r\\ndizziness coming over her and found herself swaying, but as she was a\\r\\ndancer and accustomed to whirling about, the feeling passed off in a\\r\\nmoment and she was as well as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Huh!\\\" said the ancient Iff disgustedly, \\\"why don't you turn giddy and\\r\\nfall down in a heap so I can eat you? Everybody does that when they\\r\\nlook into my eyes.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Maybe they do,\\\" replied the Dancing Pearl, \\\"but I don't. I'm too\\r\\naccustomed to whirling about to get dizzy so easy, so you'll have to\\r\\nmake a meal of something else.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" growled the monster, glaring at Floo, \\\"then I'll eat your\\r\\ngentleman friend.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, I guess not,\\\" said Floo. \\\"_I_ don't intend to look into your\\r\\nugly old eyes, no sir-ee.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, don't you?\\\" said the ancient Iff. \\\"Indeed!\\\" And with that he began\\r\\nto sing in a voice like a dozen bass drums:\\r\\n\\r\\n    In days of old when knights were bold\\r\\n      And dragons held their sway,\\r\\n    The knights all fought as warriors ought\\r\\n      To end the dragons' day.\\r\\n    And though the dragons spouted flame\\r\\n    The knights they whipped 'em just the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n    But in the days before the craze\\r\\n      For killing dragons flourished,\\r\\n    There were no tiffs with ancient Iffs\\r\\n      For Iffs were too well nourished.\\r\\n    And though some might ignore their size,\\r\\n    None could ignore their goo-goo eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    So have a care--likewise beware,\\r\\n      And look at me just so--\\r\\n    You have no chance! My flashing glance\\r\\n      Will follow where you go.\\r\\n    Gaze in my eyes--get busy,\\r\\n    And let yourself grow dizzy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Grammarsaurus sang the last verse, Floo, to his horror, found\\r\\nhimself looking into the monster's glaring eyes, and the minute he did\\r\\nthat he began to feel giddier and giddier.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Phew!\\\" he cried, \\\"I--I--I feel so wobbly I can hardly keep my feet.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ha, ha,\\\" chuckled the ancient Iff, \\\"of course you do. And presently\\r\\nyou'll feel even more wobbly, and then--\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned to the Dancing Pearl. \\\"Here,\\\" he remarked, \\\"is where I eat\\r\\nyour gentleman friend as I said I would. I guess you wish now he hadn't\\r\\ntried to take you from me when I was a hermit, don't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Indeed I do not,\\\" retorted the Dancing Pearl, \\\"for I am not going\\r\\nto let you eat my gentleman friend. Your eyes may make him dizzy but\\r\\nunless he falls in a heap you cannot eat him. And as I never get giddy\\r\\nI shall hold him up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that she put her arm about Floo's neck and drew his arm about\\r\\nher waist, and though his legs were very, very unsteady she managed to\\r\\nkeep him from falling while the Grammarsaurus walked about smacking his\\r\\nlips enviously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now look here,\\\" he said to the Dancing Pearl, \\\"you seem to forget this\\r\\nis a private matter between your gentleman friend and myself, and I\\r\\ncannot see why you mix in it, I really cannot.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, maybe you can't,\\\" replied the Dancing Pearl, \\\"but I can. So you\\r\\nmight as well shoo yourself away.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen because the ancient Iff's song had so enchanted Floo he could not\\r\\neven close his eyes but simply _had_ to keep on looking at the monster,\\r\\nshe threw her beautiful hand-embroidered handkerchief over his face,\\r\\nand presently the effect of the Grammarsaurus's stare passed away and\\r\\nFloo felt much better.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said the Dancing Pearl, \\\"if I were you I'd look in my book\\r\\nof instructions and turn this nasty old thing into something less\\r\\ndangerous.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFloo groaned. \\\"I can't,\\\" he replied. \\\"This book only tells how to\\r\\ntransform a person or a thing _once_. You see, Hoo Hoo did not think I\\r\\nwould have to do it more than once.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said the Dancing Pearl, \\\"I don't see why you cannot transform\\r\\nthis Grammarsaurus. You never transformed him before.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes, I did,\\\" responded Floo. \\\"I turned the Hermit into a lemon, and\\r\\nthis monster is only a continuation of the lemon. In other words, the\\r\\nHermit was first a lemon and now he's a Grammarsaurus, and the book\\r\\ndoesn't tell how to transform him again.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you may be sure this tickled the ancient Iff very much. As Floo\\r\\nand the Dancing Pearl conversed he had been listening with all his\\r\\nmight, and when he heard Floo confess that he did not know how to\\r\\ntransform the monster into anything else the ancient Iff gave a loud\\r\\ncheer and capered about gleefully.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My, my,\\\" he exclaimed, \\\"but I have got you two in a fix. I may not be\\r\\nable to make you so dizzy you'll fall down and I can eat you, but that\\r\\nis no reason why I cannot scrouge you so I'll be able to gobble you up\\r\\nafter a while.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he began to crowd them against the walls of the cave\\r\\nsomething awful. It was just like having a house trying to walk over\\r\\nyou, and Floo and the Dancing Pearl had to step lively to keep out of\\r\\nthe monster's way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"If we can only get outside,\\\" panted Floo, \\\"I believe I can fix him,\\r\\nfor I've thought of a plan.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"All right,\\\" said the Dancing Pearl, \\\"I'll run to the back of the cave\\r\\nand when he comes after me you run outside and before he can squash me\\r\\nI'll join you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Floo, \\\"are you quite sure you can do it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes, indeed,\\\" replied the girl. \\\"I'm as light as a feather on my\\r\\nfeet. I haven't been a dancer for nothing.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd sure enough, when the Grammarsaurus, puffing and snorting, tried\\r\\nto scrouge her to nothing at the rear of the cave, she sprang swiftly\\r\\naside, and in a moment was beside Floo outside the entrance. And then,\\r\\njust as the furious creature was galloping toward the door of the\\r\\ncavern to try to crush them outside, Floo, looking in his book, wiggled\\r\\nhis fingers and repeated hastily:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Cave, bar the monster's rage--\\r\\n      Four, three, two, one.\\r\\n    Cave, turn into a cage--\\r\\n      Do, do it, doing, done.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he stamped his foot, and bing--instead of a rocky cave there stood\\r\\nbefore them a fine, big, iron cage, strong enough to hold anything, and\\r\\ninside of it was the Grammarsaurus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" cried the Dancing Pearl, \\\"what a delightful idea!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Floo, \\\"I just happened to think that even if I couldn't\\r\\ntransform the Grammarsaurus there was no reason why I could not\\r\\ntransform the cave. So I did.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" put in the Grammarsaurus, \\\"I see you did.\\\" And after that he\\r\\nwould not say another word, but sat and sat, and chewed his tail in\\r\\nvexation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Floo, \\\"let's start for the Viceroy's palace.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo off they went, and when they got there the Viceroy of Chow Chow was\\r\\nbeside himself with joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Welcome, poetry of motion and soul of ecstasy!\\\" he cried, swinging the\\r\\nDancing Pearl high in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then when he learned how Floo had rescued her and how he wanted to\\r\\nmarry her, the Viceroy said he had no objection whatever, provided Floo\\r\\nwould let his wife dance at the palace whenever the Viceroy wanted her\\r\\nto. And as for the Grammarsaurus, he would be glad to buy the creature,\\r\\ncage and all, to put in the private zoo he had.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Grammarsaurus was brought to Chow Chow and placed on\\r\\nexhibition, and Floo and the Dancing Pearl lived happily ever\\r\\nafterwards on the generous sum that the Viceroy paid for him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n                        THE INHERITED PRINCESS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce there was a little boy named Ting who, as this story opens, was\\r\\njust celebrating his eighth birthday. And you may be sure it was a\\r\\npretty fine birthday celebration because Ting was the Crown Prince of\\r\\nPouf and heir to the throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now, Ting,\\\" said his father the King, as they stood at the palace\\r\\nwindow watching the magnificent parade given in the Prince's honor,\\r\\n\\\"I have another surprise for you. I am going to give you a chance to\\r\\nprove your princely courage by rescuing the Inherited Princess from the\\r\\nenchanted castle.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told Ting that hundreds and hundreds of years ago, this\\r\\nPrincess, who was just about Ting's age and quite beautiful, had\\r\\nbeen carried off by her uncle, a celebrated scoundrel with a magical\\r\\neducation, and shut up in an enchanted castle with a twenty-headed\\r\\nGallopus to guard her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"she must be quite an old lady by this time.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" said the King, \\\"she is just as young as ever. One never\\r\\ngrows old in an enchanted castle. But if _she_ didn't grow old the\\r\\nwicked uncle did, so much so that he finally died of it. Then as no\\r\\none had ever found a way to rescue the Princess, and as her uncle\\r\\nhad stated in his will that she was not to be set free until she\\r\\nwas rescued, the heirs of the wicked uncle had to let things go on\\r\\nas they were, so the Princess still remains in the castle with the\\r\\ntwenty-headed Gallopus on guard.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Ting, \\\"doesn't a Gallopus ever grow old?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not that I ever heard of,\\\" replied the King, \\\"or at least this one\\r\\ndoes not, for he still sits in the same spot in the castle yard as he\\r\\ndid before I was born.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Phew!\\\" exclaimed Ting, \\\"he must be a terrible creature.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the monarch, \\\"he isn't a thing to be trifled with. And\\r\\nthat is the reason I think it would be fine for you to celebrate your\\r\\nbirthday by fighting him and setting the Princess free. Don't you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"H'mm,\\\" murmured the Prince, \\\"I don't know. I can think of other things\\r\\nI would much rather do.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why, I am surprised,\\\" said the King. \\\"I should think you'd be _glad_\\r\\nof the chance. I only wish some one had suggested the idea on _my_\\r\\neighth birthday. Just think how famous you'll be if you conquer the\\r\\ntwenty-headed Gallopus.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Ting, \\\"but just think how I'll be if I don't.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Pooh! Pooh!\\\" remarked the Prime Minister, who sat on the other side\\r\\nof Ting, \\\"that's no way for a prince to talk, especially as we've\\r\\nannounced to the public that you are about to rescue the Inherited\\r\\nPrincess from the enchanted castle.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the King, \\\"and every one is talking about it, so you can't\\r\\nback out unless you wish to disgrace me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: The minute the parade was over he started off.]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd of course, as Ting had no desire to bring disgrace upon his family,\\r\\nhe saw he would have to fight the twenty-headed Gallopus whether he\\r\\nliked it or not, though how he was ever going to do it, he could not\\r\\nimagine. However, as the longer he thought about the matter the more\\r\\ndiscouraged he became, he finally decided to go and have a look at the\\r\\nmonster and see what his chances were. So the minute the parade was\\r\\nover, he started off.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow a twenty-headed Gallopus is shaped like a star with twenty points,\\r\\nand on each point is a head. And each head has two pop eyes, two big\\r\\nears, a wide mouth with a complete collection of long, sharp teeth, and\\r\\na turned up nose. And when a twenty-headed Gallopus wishes to show a\\r\\nperson that he does _not_ care for his society, he turns slowly about\\r\\nand stares at him fixedly with his forty eyes, which makes a person\\r\\nfeel _very_ uncomfortable. So you can easily imagine how Ting felt\\r\\nwhen he reached the enchanted castle and confronted the twenty-headed\\r\\nGallopus in the courtyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" cried the twenty-headed Gallopus, speaking with about ten of\\r\\nhis heads and making a fearful racket, \\\"what do you want around here?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon the Prince told him how he was expected to rescue the\\r\\nInherited Princess, and had come to see what the Gallopus looked like\\r\\nbefore he started to work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, you did, did you?\\\" roared the monster. \\\"Well, what do you think?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think,\\\" said Ting, \\\"that you're the most awful thing I ever saw.\\r\\nYou're enough to guard a dozen princesses and it isn't fair to ask a\\r\\nlittle boy of eight to fight you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's not only not fair,\\\" said the Gallopus, \\\"but it's downright mean,\\r\\nnot to say ridiculous.\\\" Then he laughed with all his heads at once\\r\\nuntil the ground actually trembled. \\\"Don't you know,\\\" he went on, \\\"that\\r\\nI'd have to lose every one of my heads before the Princess could be\\r\\nfreed? Even if you chopped off one or two it would be no use. I must\\r\\nlose _all_ of them before the spell is broken.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he burst into a rollicking ditty--\\r\\n\\r\\n    Three rousing cheers for a job like mine,\\r\\n    For I must confess it is simply fine\\r\\n    To sit all day and take your ease\\r\\n    And just do nothing as long as you please.\\r\\n    For who would dare to brave my wrath?\\r\\n    And who would dare to cross my path\\r\\n    To try and win this princess fair?\\r\\n    Oh, can you tell me who would dare?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the twenty-headed Gallopus, when he had finished, \\\"can you\\r\\ntell me who _would_ dare?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Ting, \\\"I can't. I thought maybe _I_ would, but I've changed\\r\\nmy mind.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"And quite right, too,\\\" said the monster, \\\"you show good sense, for it\\r\\nis certainly foolish to attempt what is impossible. And besides, the\\r\\nPrincess is very happy in the castle anyway.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"How do you know?\\\" asked the Prince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said the Gallopus, \\\"she has never complained, and even if she\\r\\ndid I would be too bashful to listen to her. I don't know what it is,\\r\\nbut it makes me dreadfully nervous to talk to girls. I get so confused\\r\\nand everything. Do you?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, no,\\\" said Ting, \\\"I like to talk to girls.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twenty-headed Gallopus looked at him admiringly. \\\"Hum,\\\" he said,\\r\\n\\\"you're much braver than I thought you were. No wonder you thought you\\r\\ncould fight me. And now I think you had better run along back home for\\r\\nI want to take a little nap.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ting had no intention of running back home just then, no indeed,\\r\\nfor chancing to look up at the castle windows he had seen the Princess\\r\\npeeping out at him. And one sight of her was enough to make him want to\\r\\nstay there forever. So he told the twenty-headed Gallopus not to mind\\r\\nhim but to go ahead and take his nap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I won't disturb you,\\\" he said. \\\"I'll be just as quiet as a mouse.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" replied the Gallopus, \\\"if you'll promise solemnly not to\\r\\nmake any noise or chop off any of my heads, I'll do it, for I need the\\r\\nsleep. One of my heads had a headache last night and it kept all the\\r\\nothers awake.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with that he wobbled into his cave and began to snore like twenty\\r\\nlocomotives all starting from the station at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My gracious!\\\" gasped the Prince, \\\"he needn't worry about the noise _I_\\r\\nmake.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he hurried across the courtyard until he came to the window where\\r\\nthe Princess was sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hello,\\\" he shouted at the top of his lungs. \\\"How do you do?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well, thank you,\\\" screamed the Princess, leaning out of the\\r\\nwindow. \\\"Isn't it dreadful the noise that old Gallopus makes?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Terrible,\\\" yelled Ting, thinking how lovely she was, all pink in the\\r\\nface from shouting so. \\\"I've come to rescue you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, isn't that splendid!\\\" shrieked the Princess, smiling at him. \\\"Do\\r\\nyou think you can do it?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Sure,\\\" bawled Ting, \\\"I'll find out some way. I didn't think I could at\\r\\nfirst, but since I've _seen_ you, I've simply _got_ to.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he said that the Inherited Princess grew pinker than ever and\\r\\ndid not seem to know what to say. But even if she had known what to\\r\\nsay she probably would not have said it for all of a sudden the snoring\\r\\nstopped and the twenty-headed Gallopus came hurrying out of his cave as\\r\\nmad as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Didn't you tell me you wouldn't make any noise?\\\" he demanded of Ting,\\r\\nangrily. \\\"You said if I took a nap you'd be as quiet as a mouse, and\\r\\nyet you've made such a rumpus it woke me up. Such a hooting and tooting\\r\\nI never heard.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"That wasn't me,\\\" said Ting. \\\"That was you--snoring.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I--snoring?\\\" howled the monster, furiously. \\\"Oh, that's--that's the\\r\\nworst insult yet. I never snore, sir, never. I--I wouldn't know a snore\\r\\nif I heard one. And even if I _did_ snore it would sound like a harp or\\r\\nsomething like that, and not like a roll of musketry. The idea, telling\\r\\nme I snore!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon, with every one of his twenty heads snarling, and his body\\r\\nwhirling about like a pin-wheel, the Gallopus started for the Prince.\\r\\nAnd the minute he started the Prince started also, in the opposite\\r\\ndirection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" shrieked the Princess, \\\"he'll eat you.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He'd--he'd better not,\\\" cried Ting, running around and around the\\r\\ncourtyard as fast as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Bah!\\\" shouted the Gallopus, \\\"don't tell _me_ what I'd better not do.\\r\\nAnd stop running so. How am I ever going to catch you if you run around\\r\\nso?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of which showed what a silly old thing the twenty-headed Gallopus\\r\\nwas, for he might have known that Ting would _not_ stop running around.\\r\\nIndeed, he ran so fast that the monster finally stopped and stood\\r\\npanting with his forty cheeks all puffed out. And then it was that the\\r\\nPrincess leaned out of the window, extended her hand, and Ting, giving\\r\\na leap, seized it and jumped in at the casement where she sat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now,\\\" he jeered at the monster, \\\"catch me if you can.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't need to catch you,\\\" replied the twenty-headed Gallopus,\\r\\ncalmly, \\\"the enchanted castle has caught you and that's enough, as\\r\\nyou'll soon find out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why, what do you mean?\\\" asked the Prince, in a tone of alarm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, nothing much,\\\" chuckled the monster, \\\"only that in an hour you\\r\\nwill begin to turn into a spider, that's all, but it's enough, I guess.\\r\\nHee, hee!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith another shriek the Princess fainted away, and as for Ting, he\\r\\nalmost fainted too, at the thought of turning into anything so horrid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't believe it,\\\" he said, glaring at the Gallopus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Just as you please,\\\" answered the monster, \\\"but when you're a spider\\r\\nyou'll believe it. That castle was built to hold the Princess and\\r\\nnobody else. If anybody else goes in they turn into a spider unless\\r\\nthey come out in an hour.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, you can imagine how Ting felt, and you can also imagine how the\\r\\nPrincess felt when she came out of her swoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I like you awfully, Ting,\\\" she said, \\\"but really I'm afraid I could\\r\\nnot like you as a spider.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should say not,\\\" replied the boy. \\\"I couldn't like myself that way.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he pulled out his watch, looked at it and shuddered. \\\"Only three\\r\\nquarters of an hour left,\\\" he groaned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there they sat at the window worrying and worrying and worrying,\\r\\nand wondering what to do. And underneath the window sat the\\r\\ntwenty-headed Gallopus gloating and gloating and gloating over the way\\r\\nthey were worrying. And finally the three-quarters of an hour passed\\r\\nand they knew if Ting stayed in the castle another minute he would turn\\r\\ninto a spider.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: Underneath the window sat the twenty-headed Gallopus]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" said the boy, \\\"I guess I'll have to go out and be eaten.\\r\\nIt's bad enough but I think I'd rather be eaten than be a spider.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Princess, \\\"and I think I should, too, only I _would_\\r\\nlike to disappoint that Gallopus. I know he'd much rather eat you than\\r\\nhave you turn into a spider.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, do you think so?\\\" said Ting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm sure of it,\\\" responded the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said the boy, \\\"maybe I can make a bargain with him.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he leaned out of the window and called to the monster: \\\"you might as\\r\\nwell go away now. I've decided to become a spider.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What!\\\" shouted the twenty-headed Gallopus, \\\"why, you must be crazy.\\r\\nWhy--why, it's an awful feeling to be a spider. It's much nicer to be\\r\\neaten. Come on out and I'll swallow you whole and it won't hurt a bit.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Ting, \\\"I think I prefer to be a spider.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, go on,\\\" said the Gallopus, looking awfully disappointed, \\\"you\\r\\ncan't mean it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes, I do,\\\" said the Prince, \\\"although I might change my mind if you\\r\\nlet the Princess go free.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Never,\\\" cried the monster, gnashing his teeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Very well, then,\\\" said Ting, \\\"you'll not eat _me_.\\\" And he started to\\r\\ndraw in his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Wait, wait,\\\" shouted the Gallopus, \\\"wait a moment. Let me think.\\\"\\r\\nThen after a moment he groaned. \\\"All right, I'll do it, though I ought\\r\\nto be ashamed of myself. But it has been so many years since I tasted a\\r\\nboy I simply cannot resist the temptation. So come out and be eaten and\\r\\nthe moment I gulp you down I'll go off to my cave and shut my eyes, and\\r\\nthe Princess can come out of the castle.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the instant the monster said that the Prince jumped out of the\\r\\nwindow, because he knew if he hesitated the Princess, who had been\\r\\nlistening in horrified silence, would never let him be eaten to set her\\r\\nfree.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Ah, ha!\\\" cried the Gallopus, smacking his twenty pairs of lips, when\\r\\nhe saw Ting standing before him, \\\"now I _have_ got you.\\\" Then he burst\\r\\ninto a roar of laughter. \\\"I knew that story about the spider would\\r\\nfetch you. That's the reason I made it up.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You made it up?\\\" cried Ting. \\\"Do you mean to say it wasn't true?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWith another laugh the Gallopus shook every one of his heads merrily.\\r\\n\\\"Of course it wasn't true, and only a ninny like you would have\\r\\nbelieved it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Is that so!\\\" cried the Princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as she spoke _she_ jumped out of the window and marched right up\\r\\nto the monster. \\\"You wicked, wicked creature,\\\" she said, her cheeks\\r\\nflaming and her eyes sparkling like diamonds.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as she stood there right in front of the Gallopus she looked so\\r\\nlovely Ting felt he would be willing to be eaten a dozen times for her\\r\\nsake. And as for the twenty-headed Gallopus, he blushed scarlet with\\r\\nconfusion. Of course he had often seen the Princess at her window,\\r\\nbut never before in the sunshine outside the castle where she was a\\r\\n_hundred times_ as beautiful. So he just stared and stared with all\\r\\nhis mouths open, and shuffled his hundred and twenty feet uneasily.\\r\\nAnd then all of a sudden his heads began to get dizzy, and he felt as\\r\\nthough he would sink through the ground with bashfulness. And then--as\\r\\nthe Princess, growing more dazzling every minute, advanced still\\r\\ncloser--bing--he lost his twenty heads entirely. Bing, bing, bing--each\\r\\none went off like a balloon when it bursts, and nothing remained of the\\r\\ndreadful Gallopus to worry about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hurrah! Hurrah!\\\" cried the Princess, clapping her hands. \\\"The\\r\\nenchantment is broken. I am free again and you will not be eaten after\\r\\nall, Ting. I wonder what ever made him lose his heads that way?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why,\\\" said Ting, taking her hand and liking her more than ever, \\\"don't\\r\\nyou know? Because if you don't, just come to the palace and look in a\\r\\nmirror and you will soon find out.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he said that the Princess tucked her arm in his and marched\\r\\nhim off to the palace as quick as she could.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, well, well,\\\" cried the King, jumping off his throne in\\r\\nexcitement when he saw them coming in, \\\"if this isn't the great\\r\\nsurprise of my life.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he patted Ting on the back and called him the bravest boy in the\\r\\nland. \\\"To think of conquering the twenty-headed Gallopus and rescuing\\r\\nthe Inherited Princess on your eighth birthday,\\\" he said. \\\"I never,\\r\\nnever thought you would do it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I didn't do it,\\\" said Ting. \\\"The Princess did it all herself.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd after the King had learned all that had happened he patted the\\r\\nPrincess on the back also, and then he pinched her cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I don't wonder, my dear,\\\" he said, \\\"that the Gallopus lost his heads.\\r\\nAnd I guess I'll announce that you and Ting did it between you, for\\r\\nit's all in the family, anyway.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SOCIABLE SAND WITCH ***\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\\r\\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again.

            "The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\n",
            "heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\n",
            "bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\n",
            "Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\n",
            "to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\n",
            "on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\n",
            "shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\n",
            "glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\n",

            "for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,\n",
            "as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\n",
            "on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\n",
            "stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\n",
            "His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\n",
            "behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\n",
            "father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\n",
            "sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\n",
            "‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\n",
            "shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\n",

            "be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\n",
            "little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\n",
            "very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\n",

            "believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\n",
            "a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\n",
            "blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\n",
            "time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\n",

            "her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\n",
            "will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\n",
            "his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\n",
            "newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\n",
            "\n",
            "They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\n",
            "to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\n",
            "opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\n",
            "children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\n",
            "never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\n",
            "him to the heart to leave them behind alone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\n",

            "is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\n",
            "wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\n",
            "means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:\n",
            "‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\n",
            "children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\n",
            "say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\n",
            "and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\n",
            "also.\n",
            "\n",
            "The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\n",
            "When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\n",
            "out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\n",
            "the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\n",
            "little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\n",
            "good God will help us.’\n",
            "\n",
            "Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\n",
            "beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\n",
            "than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\n",
            "in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\n",
            "‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I\n",
            "am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\n",
            "wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,\n",
            "‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\n",
            "on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\n",

            "\n",
            "The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\n",
            "never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\n",
            "the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\n",
            "you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\n",
            "the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\n",
            "it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\n",

            "no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\n",
            "night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\n",
            "Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\n",
            "which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\n",
            "the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\n",
            "thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\n",
            "them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\n",
            "they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\n",
            "too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\n",
            "and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\n",
            "berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\n",
            "legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\n",
            "asleep.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They\n",
            "began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\n",
            "help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\n",
            "was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\n",
            "which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\n",
            "when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\n",
            "and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\n",
            "which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\n",
            "that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\n",
            "were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\n",
            "have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\n",
            "some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\n",
            "broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\n",
            "against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\n",
            "from the parlour:\n",
            "\n",
            " ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\n",
            "  Who is nibbling at my little house?’\n",
            "\n",
            "The children answered:\n",

            " ‘The wind, the wind,\n",
            "  The heaven-born wind,’\n",

            "and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\n",
            "taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\n",
            "the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\n",
            "it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\n",
            "supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\n",
            "so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\n",
            "hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear\n",
            "children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\n",
            "harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them\n",
            "into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\n",
            "pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\n",
            "beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\n",
            "in them, and thought they were in heaven.\n",
            "\n",
            "The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\n",
            "a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\n",
            "little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\n",
            "into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\n",
            "day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\n",
            "a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\n",
            "When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\n",
            "malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me\n",
            "again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\n",
            "already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\n",
            "pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That\n",
            "will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\n",
            "hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\n",
            "grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\n",
            "Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch\n",
            "some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\n",
            "stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’\n",
            "Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\n",
            "forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\n",
            "\n",

            "were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\n",

            "The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\n",

            "remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\n",
            "away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\n",
            "about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\n",
            "maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\n",
            "he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\n",
            "looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\n",
            "fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\n",
            "at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I\n",
            "be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said\n",

            "The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\n",
            "of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the\n",
            "remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night\n",
            "till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\n",
            "however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\n",
            "enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\n",
            "overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\n",
            "the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\n",
            "fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\n",
            "greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for\n",

            "\n",
            "Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\n",

            "call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\n",
            "fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried\n",
            "again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\n",
            "back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’\n",
            "and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\n",
            "the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\n",
            "angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\n",
            "and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\n",
            "wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\n",
            "had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\n",
            "caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\n",
            "up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\n",
            "would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\n",
            "separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in\n",
            "exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\n",
            "but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\n",
            "whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The\n",
            "robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\n",
            "and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\n",
            "visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\n",
            "another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\n",
            "deserve; are you satisfied now!’\n",

            "After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\n",
            "the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\n",
            "and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\n",
            "steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\n",
            "goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\n",
